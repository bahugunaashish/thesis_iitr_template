abstract = {We analyzed interferometric synthetic aperture radar sentinel-1A-based observations to characterize the source of 5 April 2017 Mashhad, Iran mainshock (Mw 6.1), for the first time to understand the seismogenic potential of the source area using the estimates of co-seismic displacement and slip distribution on applying the steepest descent method (SDM). SAR pixel offsets (SPO) provided a deep insight into the co-seismic surface deformation of the entire source zone. Based on iterations of a total of 451 models, our analysis of sentinel-1A data from ascending and descending tracks revealed surface deformation occurred in an area of 40 × 30 km with a maximum co-seismic uplift of 10 cm. We estimated geodetic moment of 1.9 × 1020 Nm corresponding to the magnitude (Mw 6.0) of the Mashhad mainshock for which the rupture has a planner geometry with uniform slip dislocation in an elastic half-space with slip of 0.35 ± 0.1 m; strike of N313°E having dip of 48° of the thrust fault associated with oblique motion. The rupture length of 45 ± 3 km along-strike and 30 ± 3 km down dip has been estimated. The best-fit fault model geometry derived from SDM suggests that rupture occurred in the vicinity of the Kashafrud thrust fault, located west to the main Kopeh-Dagh Fault with its strike of 315°E. It is observed that a maximum slip of 0.35 m occurred at a depth of 8 km that extended to 10 km in the crust, which is found to be in unison to the Coulomb stress model that showed low-stressed zone is associated with the majority of events of lower magnitude (M ≤ 4.5) in NE–SW to the mainshock, whilst the EW zone to the mainshock found relatively highly stressed as a probable source for generating relatively higher magnitude earthquakes (M {\textgreater} 4.5) in the future. We infer that the estimates of co-seismic source attributes are essentially important for understanding the nature and extent of earthquake risks for Mashhad, Iran earthquake source area and of the areas of analogous geotectonic settings, elsewhere in the world.},

The rates obtained for HYDE and IISC are 37.09±1.4 and 35.68±1.7 mm/yr, respectively. The difference in the velocities of these two peninsular Indian stations with respect to Eurasia necessitated a fresh investigation into possible deformation between HYDE and IISC. Separate processing of the baseline with ambiguity resolution suggests a differential motion of 5.01±0.6 mm/yr between the two GPS sites, with HYDE moving S68°E relative to IISC. The available geological and geophysical data also suggest that this part of peninsular India is undergoing internal deformation. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Stresses in the lithosphere are one indication of processes in the Earth interior: here we present a calculation of large-scale lithospheric stresses caused by global mantle circulation. The mantle flow field is calculated based on density structures inferred from global seismic tomography. Predicted principal stress directions are compared to interpolations based on observed stresses. Agreement between predictions and observations is often good in regions where lithospheric stresses and mantle tomography are well constrained. Predicted magnitudes of scalar stress anomalies vary more strongly than predicted stress directions for various tomographic models. Hotspots preferentially occur in regions where calculated stress anomalies are tensile or slightly compressive. Results do not strongly depend on radial mantle viscosity structure, lithospheric rheology (viscous or elastic) or plate motion model. The model also predicts the directions of motion well for most plates; misfits in the predicted magnitudes can be explained qualitatively. Stress anomalies due to causes within the lithosphere (oceanic cooling with age, variations in crustal thickness, topography isostatically compensated at subcrustal levels) are also computed. Predicted stress directions in the absence of mantle flow can explain observations almost as well as mantle flow. Nevertheless, current models of mantle flow are largely in accord with interpolations of observed principal stress directions and the observed plate motions. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Sinha2005,
abstract = {The Ganga basin in the Himalayan foreland is a part of the world's largest area of modern alluvial sedimentation and supports a population of over 200 million people. The Ganga plain deposits not only provide a modern analogue for the ancient fluvial sequences of the Himalayan foreland basin but they also provide one of the most significant continental records for understanding the interplay of climate, tectonics and eustatic changes in generating thick sedimentary fills in a monsoon-dominated foreland system. Given the large dimensions of the Ganga basin and the lack of an integrated approach, the available data are fragmentary, and several important questions regarding the sedimentary architecture and the process-form relationships of the parent rivers remain unanswered. This paper reviews the available information on the near-surface Late Quaternary stratigraphy of the upper, middle and lower Ganga basin, and reports new results based on studies of river cliff sections and shallow boreholes down to {\~{}}50 m depth. We record significant variation in sedimentary architecture between the upper and middle Ganga plains in the western and eastern parts of the basin, respectively. This variation reflects geomorphic diversity (linked especially to precipitation gradients) and tectonic history in the frontal orogenic areas which, in turn, impact sediment supply into the basin. Many of the alluvial sequences in the upper Ganga basin are interrupted by discontinuities that probably reflect Quaternary climatic fluctuations. In addition to controlling the long-term accumulation rate, tectonics may have had some local influence, and the effects of eustatic changes were almost certainly limited to the deltaic region of the lower Ganga plains, extending to a maximum of 300-400 km landward.

@article{Naik2020,
abstract = {On 26th January 2001, an earthquake of magnitude Mw 7.7 occurred near Bhuj, in northwestern India, resulting in severe environmental effects. No unequivocal primary surface rupture was observed for the earthquake, but it caused widespread liquefaction and lateral spreading in the Rann of Kachchh and Little Rann. After the earthquake, several researchers collected field evidence of secondary surface rupture, rockfall, dry craters, and surface manifestations of liquefaction, including the formation of mud volcanoes and lateral spreads, in the meizoseismal area. Analysis of pre- and post-earthquake satellite images suggests that several “dry” streams in the Rann of Kachchh began to flow due to extensive liquefaction induced by the earthquake. In this present study, the macroseismic intensity of the Bhuj earthquake is evaluated by considering these environmental effects and applying the ESI-07 intensity scale to the affected area. As an outcome, the epicentral intensity of the 2001 Bhuj earthquake was determined to be XI. According to historical records and seismic catalogs, 16th June 1819 Allah Bund earthquake caused prominent surface rupture which was not so clear in the case of 2001 Bhuj earthquake, but the secondary effects were similar for both earthquakes. Considering the environmental effects caused by the 1819 Allah Bund earthquake, an intensity of XI was estimated for the epicentral area. For both earthquakes, the ESI scale yields a significant difference of one to two degrees with the traditional intensity scales. The 2001 Bhuj earthquake and 1819 Allah Bund earthquake shows similar ESI-07 intensity of XI despite of different epicentral locations. This implies the reliability of ESI-07 scale application for different earthquakes of similar dimensions in the same geological setting. This study contributes to the application of ESI-07 scale for Indian earthquakes, especially reverse faulting events, and to the future improvement of the ESI scale with emphasis on its applicability to historical earthquakes on the Indian subcontinent. Also, this study may help in future land use planning in the meizoseismal area of 1919 Allah Bund and 2001 Bhuj earthquakes.},

abstract = {Generally, the time-dependent impact force of a commercial aircraft against a rigid wall can be calculated based on the Riera's model, which consists of the static crushing force and the dynamic force. The reduction coefficient $\alpha$ is generally considered to be less than a unity in the modified Riera's function, while the influence of the impact velocity on the reduction coefficient is not investigated before. Moreover, the static crushing force is hard to be determined in practice. Thus an engineering model was proposed in the present study, and the total force was only described by the dynamic force and another velocity-dependent coefficient $\gamma$. Based on a well-defined finite element model for the commercial aircraft Boeing B737-800, the entire impact process of the aircraft impinging on a rigid wall was reproduced by the commercial software LS-DYNA, and four different impact velocities (150, 200, 250, 300 m/s) were considered. Based on the simulation results, the influences of impact velocity on the two coefficients ($\alpha$ and $\gamma$) were investigated and discussed by matching the aircraft impact force/impulse with the reaction force/impulse of the rigid wall. Finally, two formulas for the effects of impact velocity on the two coefficients were proposed, which is helpful for the engineers in designing and assessing the protecting shell of the nuclear power plant.},

This article proposes a mechanistic approach to quantify seismic and fault activity, thereby overcoming the difficulties in the existing empirical procedure. A finite element (FE) model for Indian Plate, with the geological ‘cratons' is developed and subject to plate driving forces namely, the ridge push and the slab pull forces. The material properties and the thickness of both plate and cratons are obtained through inversion using the recently available Global Positioning System (GPS) data. The tectonic faults are modeled using the well-known ‘extended FE method (XFEM)'. The simulated strains at fault level are compared with the computed strain rates from the earthquake catalog. Further, the procedure to quantify fault activity is demonstrated for Gujarat, India.},

Shear wave splitting is not detected at 16 stations, most of which are located near and to the north of the Indus-Yalong suture (M). For the first time anisotropy with an N-S fast direction and 0.4-1 s delay times is observed to the region about 50 km south of the IYS. This weak anisotropy correlates with the flat part of the subducting Indian lithosphere and could be caused by northward asthenospheric flow and shear at the base of the Indian lithosphere. The null measurements in the vicinity of the IYS are most likely the result of a vertical asthenos pheric flow, the comer flow induced by the subvertical subduction of the Indian lithosphere just south of the Bangong-Nujiang suture (BNS). Observations of the systematic changes in mantle anisotropy from southern Tibet to the central Tibet provide evidence for different mantle flow fields between the Indian and the Eurasian asthenospheric mantle, which are separated by a subvertical Indian lithosphere at the BNS.

Boundary conditions (BCs, see also sec. ??) for PDEs that specify values of the solution function (here T) to be constant, such as eq. (2), are called Dirichlet boundary conditions. We can also choose to specify the gradient of the solution function, e.g. ∂T/∂x (Neumann boundary condition). This gradient boundary condition corresponds to heat flux for the heat equation and we might choose, e.g., zero flux in and out of the domain (isolated BCs): ∂T ∂x (x = −L/2, t) = 0 (5) ∂T ∂x (x = L/2, t) = 0. 1.2 Solving an implicit finite difference scheme As before, the first step is to discretize the spatial domain with n x finite difference points.

abstract = {The structure of mantle convection and spatial fields of superlitho static pressure and vertical and horizontal stresses in the Earth's mantle are studied in a 2D numerical model with non-Newtonian viscosity and heat sources. The model demonstrates a jump-like motion of subduction zones and reveals abrupt changes in the stress fields depending on the stage of slab detachment. The stresses decrease dramatically in the areas without slabs. The horizontal stresses oxx, superlitho static pressure, and vertical stresses ozz in the part of the mantle lacking intense near-vertical flows are approximately equal, varying within ±6, ±8, and ±10MPa, respectively. However, these fields are stronger in the areas of descending slabs, where the values of the above parameters are about an order of magnitude higher (±50MPa).This result agrees with the current views of the oceanic slabs as the most important gent of mantle convection. We have found significant differences among the oxx, ozz, and pressure fields. The pressure field reveals both the vertical and horizontal features of slabs and plumes, clearly showing their long thermal conduits with broader heads. The distributions of oxx are sensitive to the near-horizontal parts of the flows, whereas the ozz fields reveal mainly their vertical substructures. The model shows the presence of relatively cold remnants of slabs in the lower mantle above the thermal boundary layer. Numerous hot plumes penetrating through these high-viscosity remnants, as well as the new descending slabs, induce intense stress fields in the lower mantle, which are strongly inhomogeneous in space and time. {\textcopyright} 2014 .},

abstract = {[1] We present a new global model for Recent plate velocities, REVEL, describing the relative velocities of 19 plates and continental blocks. The model is derived from publicly available space geodetic (primarily GPS) data for the period 1993-2000. We include an independent and rigorous estimate for GPS velocity uncertainties to assess plate rigidity and propagate these uncertainties to the velocity estimates. The velocity fields for North America, Eurasia, and Antarctica clearly show the effects of glacial isostatic adjustment, and Australia appears to depart from rigid plate behavior in a manner consistent with the mapped intraplate stress field. Two thirds of tested plate pairs agree with the NUVEL-1A geologic (3 Myr average) velocities within uncertainties. Three plate pairs (Caribbean-North America, Caribbean-South America, and North America-Pacific) exhibit significant differences between the geodetic and geologic model that may reflect systematic errors in NUVEL-1A due to the use of seafloor magnetic rate data that do not reflect the full plate rate because of tectonic complexities. Most other differences probably reflect real velocity changes over the last few million years. Several plate pairs (Arabia-Eurasia, Arabia-Nubia, Eurasia-India) move more slowly than the 3 Myr NUVEL-1A average, perhaps reflecting long-term deceleration associated with continental collision. Several other plate pairs, including Nazca-Pacific, Nazca-South America and Nubia-South America, are experiencing slowing that began similar to25 Ma, the beginning of the current phase of Andean crustal shortening.},

abstract = {This paper presents an extensive laboratory investigation of the non-linear rheological mechanical characteristics of hard rock under cyclic incremental loading and unloading. A data processing algorithm is proposed to analyze the experimental data, determine the instantaneous elastic and plastic strain components, visco-elastic and visco-plastic strain components from the total strain, and separate the visco-elastic and visco-plastic strain curves from the total creep strain curves. The elasto-viscoplastic rheological behavior of iherzolite specimens at various confining pressures is thoroughly studied using the obtained experimental data. Based on the data, a non-linear elasto-viscoplastic rheological model containing various deformation components is proposed, by connecting a Hooke body, a parallel combination of Hooke and plastic slide bodies, a Kelvin body, and a generalized Bingham body. The proportion of instantaneous plastic strain component in the total instantaneous strain has increasing tendency with higher deviatoric stress on a whole. The instantaneous elastic modulus of specimen tends to increase with higher deviatoric stress and confining pressure, the instantaneous plastic modulus of specimen is decreased with higher deviatoric stress at confining pressures of 3 and 6 MPa on the whole, however, has no evident relationship with deviatoric stress, when confining pressure is increased to 9 and 16 MPa. The proportion of the visco-plastic strain component in the creep strain is increased with higher deviatoric stress. The steady-state creep strain rate versus deviatoric stress relationship can be well described with an exponential expression. The elasto-viscoplastic characteristics of radial creep is similar to that of axial creep, but radial creep strain is only 25–30{\%} of axial creep strain, steady-state creep rate in radial direction is about 35{\%} of that in axial direction.},

abstract = {The plate boundary between India and Sunda plates across the Indo-Burmese arc (IBA) region is probably the most neglected domain as far as the plate motion, crustal deformation and earthquake occurrence processes are concerned. Because of the limited or no geodetic measurements across the IBA region, debate continues on the most appropriate plate boundary model for the region. Subduction along this boundary occurred in geological past, but whether it is still active is a debatable issue. It is believed that the predominantly northward India-Sunda relative plate motion of about 36 mm/year is partitioned between the Indo-Burmese wedge (IBW) and the Sagaing Fault (SF). However, it is not clear how relative plate motion between India and Sunda plates is accommodated across the IBA region - whether localized, partitioned or distributed, and in particular what is the slip rate and mode of slip accommodation across faults in the region? In such cases, Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements of crustal deformation have proved to be the best and probably the only tool. Our detailed seismo-tectonic study, crustal deformation study using high precision GPS measurements of eight years, strain rate estimates, field studies, analytical and finite element modelling of GPS data from the IBW region in North East India provide evidence for present-day active deformation front (or the plate boundary fault) between the India and Burma plates. On the basis of our extensive studies, it is now suggested that the Churachandpur-Mao Fault (CMF), a geologically older thrust fault, accommodates motion of about 16 mm/year through dextral strike-slip manner. The motion across the CMF constitutes about 43{\%} of the relative plate motion of 36 mm/year between the India and Sunda plates. The remaining motion is accommodated at SF. On the basis of modelling, which suggests low friction along the CMF, absence of low-magnitude seismicity along the CMF, lack of historic and great and major earthquakes on the CMF and regions around it, and field studies, it is proposed that the motion across the CMF occurs predominantly in an aseismic manner. Such behaviour of the CMF significantly lowers the seismic hazard in the region.},

abstract = {The combined pile–raft foundation (CPRF) has been widely recognized as economic and rational foundation for high-rise buildings when subjected to vertical loading because of its effectiveness in load sharing by both raft and pile components. This results in smaller total and differential settlements with a reduced number of piles as compared with group piles. Until recently, the behavior of CPRF when subjected to lateral and real earthquake loading conditions in addition to vertical loads has not been well understood as a result of the complexities involved in the interaction of the pile, soil, and raft under such loading considerations. In the present study, an attempt has been made to investigate the behavior of CPRF with the use of centrifuge testing and a numerical model under pseudostatic and dynamic loading conditions carried out with finite-element software. After successful validation of the present CPRF model with both centrifuge and numerical model results, the same model was used for further study under El-Centro 1979, Loma Prieta 1989, Bhuj 2001 and Sikkim 2011 real earthquake pseudostatic loading and real acceleration–time history. The maximum displacement and bending moment were observed at the pile head, which is attributable to the rigid fixity of the piles with the raft. The crossover point in the bending moment profile was observed at shallow depths for all cases of loading. The occurrence of the resonance condition that yielded maximum horizontal displacement of the CPRF as a result of one of the input motions is also highlighted in the present study. The difference in the response of soil just below the raft of the CPRF and at the far field indicated that near-field and far-field ground motions were not in tandem. A case study on an existing CPRF of Messeturm Tower, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, is also presented. The existing CPRF of Messeturm Tower was modeled and analyzed under static and pseudostatic loading conditions. Obtained results show good correlation with the static field-measured results. Results in terms of bending moment in piles, total settlements, and normalized lateral displacement ( u/D) are reported. The present findings are useful because they provide broader understanding of the response of the CPRF under pseudostatic and dynamic loading conditions.},

abstract = {The south Indian shield is a collage of Precambrian terrains gathered around and in part derived from the Archean-age Dharwar craton. We operated seven broadband seismographs on the shield along a N-S corridor from Nanded (NND) to Bangalore (BGL) and used data from these to determine the seismic characteristics of this part of the shield. Surface wave dispersion and receiver function data from these sites and the Geoscope station at Hyderabad (HYB) give the shear wave velocity structure of the crust along this 600 km long transect. Inversion of Rayleigh wave phase velocity measured along the profile shows that the crust has an average thickness of 35 km and consists of a 3.66 km s-1, 12 km thick layer overlying a 3.81 km s-1, 23 km thick lower crust. At all sites, the receiver functions are extremely simple, indicating that the crust beneath each site is also simple with no significant intracrustal discontinuities. Joint inversion of the receiver function and surface wave phase velocity data shows the seismic characteristics of this part of the Dharwar crust to be remarkably uniform throughout and that it varies within fairly narrow bounds: crustal thickness (35 ± 2 km), average shear wave speed (3.79 ± 0.09 km s-1), and Vp/Vs ratio (1.746 ± 0.014). There is no evidence for a high velocity basal layer in the receiver function crustal images of the central Dharwar craton, suggesting that there is no seismically distinct layer of mafic cumulates overlying the Moho and implying that the base of the Dharwar crust has remained fairly refractory since its cratonization.},

The Shillong plateau and Mikir hills, away from the convergent margins, reveal remarkably simple crust with thickness (∼35 km) and Poisson's ratio (∼0.25), akin to the Indian shield values. A surprisingly thin crust for the uplifted Shillong plateau may be explained invoking presence of an uncompensated crust that popped up in response to tectonic forces. In contrast, crustal signatures from Assam valley suggest a thicker crust and higher Poisson's ratio with evidences for a dipping Moho.

abstract = {In regions with long historical earthquake records, seismic hazard assessments are additionally challenged by the large uncertainties related to the available pre-instrumental data. A major source of uncertainty is the incompleteness of historical earthquake records. Therefore, an important step in seismic hazard assessment is the check of completeness for different intensity levels and the removal of aftershock sequences. Mainly two different approaches have been proposed for checking the completeness of seismic catalogues: the temporal course of earthquake frequency (TCEF), and a completeness check based on statistical analysis of the mean earthquake recurrence interval for varying time windows. We systematically compared the effects of the different methods on the Gutenberg-Richter relation (GR-relation), as well as the influence of removing fore- and aftershocks. For that purpose we created and declustered a new composite catalogue for Austria, the Vienna Basin and a 100 km wide region outside the boundaries of Austria and Vienna Basin based on four different earthquake catalogues. We can show that the a- and bvalues for the GR-relations derived from different completeness analyses depend on the correction method used. Corrections with the TCEF seem to produce lower a- and b-values. The Stepp method, on the other hand, excludes the highest intensity class (I0 =X) and tends to calculate lower a- and b-parameters. Based on these results, we prefer the latter. Both completeness methods have further been applied to a subset of the composite catalogue corresponding to a source zone including the active Vienna Basin fault system. Comparison shows that completeness of the entire dataset is apparently overestimated.},

If its value reaches one the material is fully broken, thus both its stiffness and stress are reduced to zero. The elastic displacement and the fracture problem are decoupled and solved separately as a staggered solution. The approach does not need predefined cracks and it can simulate curvilinear fracture paths, branching and even crack coalescence. Several examples are provided to explain the advantages and disadvantages of the method.

abstract = {We develop a three-dimensional viscoelastic finite element model to study postseismic deformation associated with the 1960 great Chile earthquake. GPS observations 35 years after the earthquake show that, while all coastal sites are moving landward, a group of inland sites 200-400 km from the trench are moving seaward and that coastal velocities in the 1960 rupture area are distinctly smaller than those to the north. We explain these observations in terms of mantle stress relaxation. The earthquake stretches the upper plate to move seaward, but elastic stresses coseismically induced in the upper mantle resist this motion. Stress relaxation allows seaward motion to take place in the inland area for several decades following the earthquake. With a viscosity of 2.5 × 1019 Pa s for the continental upper mantle, the model well explains the GPS observations. Numerical tests suggest that the continental mantle viscosity value is reasonably well constrained. The model shows the prolonged postseismic seaward motion of the inland area to be a unique feature of earthquakes with very long rupture along strike and large coseismic fault slip. For short rupture and small coseismic slip, the motion will stop very quickly after the earthquake, explaining why this phenomenon is not more commonly observed. With an oceanic mantle viscosity of 1020 Pa s, the model also provides an explanation for tide-gauge constrained postseismic uplift 200 km from the trench that had previously been explained using a model of prolonged afterslip of a deep segment of the Chile subduction fault.

abstract = {Seismic-hazard estimates require merging datasets from seismology, geodesy, and geology that have different footprints, which works best when there is a global model that relates them. The rigid-plate model serves this purpose for plate-boundary hazard estimation but fails for intraplate hazard. The global thin-shell finite-element model of the lithosphere by Bird (1998) is a first attempt at a model with realistic intraplate regions. It is based on stress equilibrium and assumed flow laws for the lithosphere, incorporates topographic and geothermal variations and plate-boundary faults and predicts long-term anelastic strain rates in all plate interiors. For comparison, the historical seismic catalog JISSIG (Utsu, 1996) and the instrumental catalog CMT are converted to seismic strain rates in intraplate regions corresponding to the finite elements. Spatial correlations are tested between the logarithms of strain rates in order to reduce the dominance of the greatest earthquakes. The finite-element model has correlations of 0.391 with JISSIG and 0.338 with CMT, neither of which is as high as the correlation of JISSIG with CMT (0.476). This may mean that the model is defective or that intraplate seismicity contains a large fraction of aftershocks and other triggered events. If we take the CMT dataset as representative of the short-term intraplate seismicity that we might try to forecast, then multiple regression shows that this is best correlated (0.504) with a 56/44{\%} mixture of the JISSIG and finite-element model strain rates. The contribution of the finite-element model, though small, is significant with 99.9{\%} confidence.},

abstract = {We present four companion digital models of the age, age uncertainty, spreading rates, and spreading asymmetries of the world's ocean basins as geographic and Mercator grids with 2 arc min resolution. The grids include data from all the major ocean basins as well as detailed reconstructions of back-arc basins. The age, spreading rate, and asymmetry at each grid node are determined by linear interpolation between adjacent seafloor isochrons in the direction of spreading. Ages for ocean floor between the oldest identified magnetic anomalies and continental crust are interpolated by geological estimates of the ages of passive continental margin segments. The age uncertainties for grid cells coinciding with marine magnetic anomaly identifications, observed or rotated to their conjugate ridge flanks, are based on the difference between gridded age and observed age. The uncertainties are also a function of the distance of a given grid cell to the nearest age observation and the proximity to fracture zones or other age discontinuities. Asymmetries in crustal accretion appear to be frequently related to asthenospheric flow from mantle plumes to spreading ridges, resulting in ridge jumps toward hot spots. We also use the new age grid to compute global residual basement depth grids from the difference between observed oceanic basement depth and predicted depth using three alternative age-depth relationships. The new set of grids helps to investigate prominent negative depth anomalies, which may be alternatively related to subducted slab material descending in the mantle or to asthenospheric flow. A combination of our digital grids and the associated relative and absolute plate motion model with seismic tomography and mantle convection model outputs represents a valuable set of tools to investigate geodynamic problems.},

abstract = {A damaging and widely felt moderate (Mw 5.0) earthquake occurred in the Talala region of Saurashtra, Gujarat (western India) on November 6, 2007. The highly productive sequence comprised about 1300 micro earthquakes (M{\textgreater}0.5) out of which 325 of M≥ 1.5 that occurred during November 6, 2007-January 10, 2008 were precisely located. The spatial aftershock distribution revealed a NE-SW striking fault in accordance with the centroid moment tensor solution, which in turn implies left-lateral motion. The orientation and sense of shear are consistent with similarly orientated geological fault identified in the area from satellite imagery and field investigation.The aftershocks temporal decay, b-value of frequency-magnitude distribution, spatial fractal dimension, D, and slip ratio (ratio of the slip occurred on the primary fault to the total slip) were examined with the purpose to identify the properties of the sequence. The high b-value (1.18 ± 0.01) may be attributed to the paucity of the larger (M≥4.0) aftershocks and reveals crustal heterogeneity and low stress regime. The high p-value (1.10 ± 0.39), implying fast decay rate of aftershocks, evidences high surface heat flux. A value of the spatial fractal dimension (D) equal to 2.21 ± 0.02 indicates random spatial distribution and source in a two-dimensional plane that is being filled-up by fractures. A slip ratio of 0.42 reveals that more slip occurred on secondary fault systems.The static Coulomb stress changes due to the coseismic slip of the main shock, enhanced off fault aftershock occurrence. The occurrence of a moderate earthquake (Mw 4.3) on October 5, 2008 inside a region of positive Coulomb stress changes supports the postulation on aftershock triggering. When the stress changes were resolved on a cross section including the stronger (M4.8) foreshock plane that is positioned adjacent to the main fault, it became evident that the activity continued there due to stress transfer from the main rupture. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {NaBH4 hydrolysis can generate pure hydrogen on demand at room temperature, but suffers from the difficult regeneration for practical application. In this work, we overview the state-of-the-art progress on the regeneration of NaBH4 from anhydrous or hydrated NaBO2 that is a byproduct of NaBH4 hydrolysis. The anhydrous NaBO2 can be regenerated effectively by MgH2, whereas the production of MgH2 from Mg requires high temperature to overcome the sluggish hydrogenation kinetics. Compared to that of anhydrous NaBO2, using the direct hydrolysis byproduct of hydrated NaBO2 as the starting material for regeneration exhibits significant advantages, i.e., omission of the high-temperature drying process to produce anhydrous NaBO2 and the water included can react with chemicals like Mg or Mg2Si to provide hydrogen. It is worth emphasizing that NaBH4 could be regenerated by an energy efficient method and a large-scale regeneration system may become possible in the near future.},

abstract = {Modeling of receiver functions computed using data from the IRIS broadband station PALK in Sri Lanka reveals a simple crust with a thickness of 34 km. The crust appears to be more felsic with dominance of quartzite, as evidenced by a low Poisson's ratio of 0.25 compared to the global average for Precambrian shields. An overview of crustal composition of the high-grade terrains of Gondwana land reveals that Poisson's ratios mostly lie in the range of 0.24-0.26. These lower than global average values from both Archean and Proterozoic shields, including the metamorphic regions appear to be characteristic of Precambrian shields consistent with the average continental crust composition estimates showing 59{\%} silica content. The two principal mantle discontinuities beneath PALK are found at 418 and 678 km, respectively, which are both deeper than the global averages, suggesting a hotter upper mantle. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {PSHA is the method used most to assess seismic hazards for input into various aspects of public and financial policy. For example, PSHA was used by the U.S. Geological Survey to develop the National Seismic Hazard Maps (Frankel et al., 1996, 2002). These maps are the basis for many national, state, and local seismic safety regulations and design standards, such as the NEHRP Recommended Provisions for Seismic Regulations for New Buildings and Other Structures, the International Building Code, and the International Residential Code. Adoption and implementation of these regulations and design standards would have significant impacts on many communities in the New Madrid area, including Memphis, Tennessee and Paducah, Kentucky. Although "mitigating risks to society from earthquakes involves economic and policy issues" (Stein, 2004), seismic hazard assessment is the basis. Seismologists should provide the best information on seismic hazards and communicate them to users and policy makers. There is a lack of effort in communicating the uncertainties in seismic hazard assessment in the central U.S., however. Use of 10{\%}, 5{\%}, and 2{\%} PE in 50 years causes confusion in communicating seismic hazard assessment. It would be easy to discuss and understand the design ground motions if the true meaning of the ground motion derived from PSHA were presented, i.e., the ground motion with the estimated uncertainty or the associated confidence level.},

Moreover, combining with viscous-elastic shearing rheological model of rock mass in series, a new constitutive model of visco-elasticity-plasticity considering the rheology was constructed. Due to the shearing rheological curves of granite, the model of visco-elasticity-plasticity considering the rheology was identified and the rheological parameters of the model were obtained. The comparison between the viscous-elastic-plastic rheological model of rock mass and experimental result of granite shows that the accelerating rheological properties of rock mass can be depicted effectively by the constitutive model of visco-elasticity-plasticity considering the rheology.},

abstract = {Time-dependent features of rocks and rock masses, particularly soft rocks, may emerge in most tunnels, mines and underground constructions under different deviatoric stress levels. To account for the creep deformation of rocks associated with the wide range of stress levels, modifications are made to a visco-plastic model which was initially developed for large stresses in squeezing conditions. Firstly, the concept of plastic hardening behavior is adopted for both instantaneous and visco-plastic deformations of rocks to estimate the induced plastic deformation even at relatively low deviatoric stress levels. Secondly, the visco-plastic dashpot element is described as a function of the stress level to determine the secondary stage of creep during the unloading and reloading phases which are crucial in tunneling and underground. The governing equations of the proposed model are implemented in numerical finite difference code (FLAC), using its built-in FISH language for constitutive models and then applied to a series of laboratory creep tests presented in the literature. The presented discussion compares the numerical results relating to the modified model with the data on time-dependent deformation developed in rock specimens.},

Three of the largest (M {\textgreater} 7.5) historic intraplate earthquakes occurred within the Indian subcontinent, suggesting the possibility of significant intraplate deformation. We consider surface velocities determined from new GPS data collected at 29 continuous GPS stations and 41 survey-mode GPS stations in India between 1995 and 2007 to find a north-south shortening rate of 0.3 ± 0.05 nanostrain yr−1, which may be accommodated by 2 ± 1 mm/yr of more localized convergence across central India. Southward motions at 4–7 mm/yr of sites on the Shillong plateau in northeast India reflect rapid shortening and high earthquake hazard associated with active thrust faults bounding the plateau. The width and magnitude of the elastic strain accumulation field across the Himalaya varies little from ∼76°–90° longitude, but the strain is more broadly distributed and convergence rates are higher along the eastern ∼200 km of the range.},

The observed orientations of SHmax vary considerably and often differ from the plate velocity direction. We have simulated orientation and magnitude of SHmax through finite element modeling incorporating heterogeneities in elastic property of the Indian continent and plain stress approximation to understand the variability of SHmax. Four different scenarios are tested in simulation: (1) homogeneous plate with fixed plate boundary (2) homogeneous plate with boundary forces (3) heterogeneous plate with fixed boundary (4) heterogeneous plate with boundary forces. The estimated orientation and magnitude of SHmax with a heterogeneous plate with boundary forces in the Himalayan region and an eastern plate boundary comprising the Indo-Burmese arc and Andaman subduction zone are consistent with measured maximum horizontal stress. This study suggests that plate boundary force varies along the northern Indian plate margin and also provides a constraint on the intraplate stress field in the Indian subcontinent.},

abstract = {Approximately 2200 magnetic anomaly crossings and 800 fracture zone crossings flanking the Carlsberg ridge and Central Indian ridge are used to estimate the rotations of the Indian and Capricorn plates relative to the Somalian Plate for 20 distinct points in time since 20 Ma. The data are further used to place limits on the locations of the northern edge of the rigid Capricorn Plate and of the southern edge of the rigid Indian Plate along the Central Indian ridge. Data south of and including fracture zone N (the fracture zone immediately south of the Vema fracture zone), which intersects the Central Indian ridge near 10°S, are well fit assuming rigid Capricorn and Somalian plates, while data north of fracture zone N are not, in agreement with prior results. Data north of fracture zone H, which intersects the Central Indian ridge near 3.2°S, are well fit assuming rigid Indian and Somalian plates, while data south of and including fracture zone H are not, resulting in a smaller rigid Indian Plate and a wider diffuse oceanic plate boundary than found before. The data are consistent with Capricorn-Somalia motion about a fixed pole since ≈8 Ma, but require rotation about a pole 15° farther away from the Central Indian ridge from 20 to ≈8 Ma. The post-8-Ma pole also indicates Capricorn-Somalia displacement directions that are 7° clockwise of those indicated by the pre-8-Ma stage pole. In contrast, India-Somalia anomaly and fracture crossings are well fit by a single fixed pole of rotation for the past 20 Ma. India-Somalia motion has changed little during the past 20 Myr. Nonetheless, astronomically calibrated ages for reversals younger than 12.9 Ma allow resolution of the following small but significant changes in spreading rate: India-Somalia spreading slowed from 31 to 28 mm yr-1near 7.9 Ma and later sped up to 31 mm yr-1near 3.6 Ma; Capricorn-Somalia spreading slowed from 40 to 36 mm yr-1near 11.0 Ma, later sped up to 38 mm yr-1near 5.1 Ma and further sped up to 40 mm yr-1near 2.6 Ma. The motion between the Indian and Capricorn plates is estimated by differencing India-Somalia and Capricorn-Somalia rotations, which differ significantly for all 20 pairs of reconstructions. India has rotated relative to the Capricorn Plate since at least ≈20 Ma. If about a pole located near 4°S, 75°E, the rate of rotation was slow, 0.11° ± 0.01° Myr-1(95 per cent confidence limits), from 20 to 8 Ma, but increased to 0.28° ± 0.01° Myr-1(95 per cent confidence limits) at ≈8 Ma. The onset of more rapid rotation coincides, within uncertainty, with the inferred onset at 7-8 Ma of widespread thrust faulting in the Central Indian basin, and with the hypothesized attainment of maximum elevation and initiation of collapse of the Tibetan plateau at ≈8 Ma. The plate kinematic data are consistent with steady India-Capricorn motion since 8 Ma and provide no evidence for previously hypothesized episodic motions during that interval. The convergence since 8 Ma between the Indian and Capricorn plates significantly exceeds (by 13 to 20 km) the convergence estimated from three north-south marine seismic profiles in the Central Indian basin. Where and how the additional convergence was accommodated is unclear. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

abstract = {The present study elucidates velocity of the Indian plate from 2013 to 2016 with the help of six continuously operating permanent Global Positioning System (GPS) stations and tracks the crustal motion and direction directly by means of space-based geodetic measurements. The GPS derived velocity estimates were computed with respect to 2008 International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF 08) and carried out almost all along the arc in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). The velocity vectors indicate that the Indian plate is moving towards the NE direction (average velocity of 46.95 ± 0.23 mm/yr) with higher movement towards the eastward direction (36.11 ± 0.17 mm/yr) compared to the northward direction (29.02 ± 0.16 mm/yr). Variations in the plate motion between IISC and permanent GPS stations suggest that presently, the convergence rate is about 8.06 ± 0.28 mm/yr and 5.71 ± 0.17 mm/yr for Higher Himalaya and Lesser Himalaya respectively. In addition, the deformation rate was also calculated on the basis of baseline shortening between IGS stations (IISC and LHAZ) and permanent GPS stations. The results suggest that the deformation is about 11.68 ± 1.32 mm/yr above the Main Central Thrust (MCT) and 6.74 ± 1.20 mm/yr above the Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) with respect to the Indian plate (IISC), while it is 20.60 ± 1.76 mm/yr above the MCT and 11.42 ± 1.21 mm/yr above the MBT with respect to Eurasian plate (LHAZ). The strain rate through GPS measurement reveals that the maximum strain is accumulated in the central part of the Himalaya between the MBT and MCT, indicating vulnerability of the central Indian Himalaya for future earthquakes.},

abstract = {In practice it is common to estimate site effects using a single proxy, or single variable such as 30 m shear wave velocity (VS30) or site period. Many studies have investigated merits of proposed proxies with contradicting recommendations. Yet, most studies indicate the single proxy approach is less than ideal, resulting in large uncertainty. To provide a better understanding of components that drive site response, we performed a parameterized study on 19 shallow soil profiles with VS ranging from 150 m/s to 400 m/s. We propagated 74 input motions through each soil column using one-dimensional equivalent-linear method to produce 1406 site response analyses. The resulting amplification factors (the ratio of surface to base motion) were then analyzed statistically to identify trends. The mean amplification factor, averaged from 74 records, was used to isolate and quantify the effects of VS on site response. Based on analysis of record-to-record trends, we identified two separate mechanisms through which nonlinearity affects site response including “damping increase” and “site period shift”. The interaction of these two mechanisms makes amplification-shaking intensity models highly depth-dependent. The residual standard deviation of amplification factor based on depth-independent models was found to be up to three times larger than the corresponding standard deviation based on depth-specific models. We found strain compatible site period a promising site parameter that complements the predictive information obtained from VS. Finally, a simplified procedure providing a five-point estimate of site transfer function is outlined. The proposed procedure can fill the gap in current practice for an intermediate solution between the numerically rigorous solution and the single proxy approach. Implementation of this procedure is demonstrated in an example.},

abstract = {The Indian subcontinent is a part of a very dynamic crustal plate that is converging northwards towards mainland Asia at a rate which varies in time and space. Within its fragmented framework, a large number of faults and shear zones developed thousands and even millions of years ago. Reactivated time and again due to the buildup of stresses resulting from the northwards movement of the Indian continental plate, these faults and fractures have played a primary role in the shaping of the landforms and landscapes that we see today. The movements on rupture planes also constrained the establishment of drainage patterns and the aberrations in river behaviour. It is the rupture-related dislocation of landforms and the sinking and rising of the fault-affected ground that brought about discernible physiographic changes, particularly where there were continued and ongoing movements, such as in the Himalayan province pressed hard between the northwards-pushing Peninsular India and the Asian landmass. Recurrent seismicity provides eloquent testimony to the neotectonic resurgence of the faulted terrains and the terrane-defining faults.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Since the 1970s, numerous global plate tectonic models have been proposed to reconstruct the Earth's evolution through deep time. The reconstructions have proven immensely useful for the scientific community. However, we are now at a time when plate tectonic models must take a new step forward. There are two types of reconstructions: those using a ‘single control' approach and those with a ‘dual control' approach. Models using the ‘single control' approach compile quantitative and/or semi-quantitative data from the present-day world and transfer them to the chosen time slices back in time. The reconstructions focus therefore on the position of tectonic elements but may ignore (partially or entirely) tectonic plates and in particular closed tectonic plate boundaries. For the readers, continents seem to float on the Earth's surface. Hence, the resulting maps look closer to what Alfred Wegener did in the early twentieth century and confuse many people, particularly the general public. With the ‘dual control' approach, not only are data from the present-day world transferred back to the chosen time slices, but closed plate tectonic boundaries are defined iteratively from one reconstruction to the next. Thus, reconstructions benefit from the wealth of the plate tectonic theory. They are physically coherent and are suited to the new frontier of global reconstruction: the coupling of plate tectonic models with other global models. A joint effort of the whole community of geosciences will surely be necessary to develop the next generation of plate tectonic models.},

The aim of this paper is to preliminary evaluate the effects and consequences of the energy transmitted to the outer containment walls (according to the international safety and design code guidelines, as NRC or IAEA ones) due to a military or civil aircraft impact into a nuclear plant, considered as a 'beyond design basis' event. To perform reliable analysis of such a large-scale structure and determine the structural effects of the propagation of this types of impulsive loads (response of containment structure), a realistic but still feasible numerical model with suitable materials characteristics were used by means of which relevant physical phenomena are reflected. Moreover a sensitivity analysis has also been carried out considering the effects of different containment wall thickness and reinforced/prestressed concrete features. The obtained results were analysed to check the NPP containment strength margins. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A deep seismic reflection study across the Aravalli Delhi Fold Belt, situated in the northwestern part of the Indian Shield, has revealed a deep penetrating 25-km-wide crustal-scale thrust fault, dipping reflections from the upper crust to the Moho and a divergent reflection fabric. Paleo-subduction zones and island-arc signatures are identified from the present study. Seismic images of the crust reveal tectonics of the region with two distinct episodes of rifting, sedimentation, collision and suturing corresponding to the Aravalli and Delhi orogenies. Plate tectonic processes were responsible for the evolution of the Paleo-proterozoic Aravalli and Mesoproterozoic Delhi Fold Belts with the juxtaposition of the Bundelkhand craton in the east and the Marwar craton in the west. A 50-$\omega$ m electrical conductor, extending to a depth of 25 km, and a steep gradient gravity anomaly of 70 mGal, extending all along the strike of the fold belt with conspicuous lows on either side, correlate well with the deep-seated dipping reflections/sutures inferred from the seismic reflection data. The present study suggests that a high-velocity, thick crust was produced in the Proterozoic orogens of the region. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A simplified approach to applying the Finite Element Method to geotechnical problems. Predicting soil behavior by constitutive equations that are based on experimental findings and embodied in numerical methods, such as the finite element method, is a significant aspect of soil mechanics. Engineers are able to solve a wide range of geotechnical engineering problems, especially inherently complex ones that resist traditional analysis. Applied Soil Mechanics with ABAQUS{\textregistered} Applications provides civil engineering students and practitioners with a simple, basic introduction to applying the finite element method to soil mechanics problems. Accessible to someone with little background in soil mechanics and finite element analysis, Applied Soil Mechanics with ABAQUS{\textregistered} Applications explains the basic concepts of soil mechanics and then prepares the reader for solving geotechnical engineering problems using both traditional engineering solutions and the more versatile, finite element solutions. Topics covered include: Properties of Soil Elasticity and Plasticity Stresses in Soil Consolidation Shear Strength of Soil Shallow Foundations Lateral Earth Pressure and Retaining Walls Piles and Pile Groups Seepage. Taking a unique approach, the author describes the general soil mechanics for each topic, shows traditional applications of these principles with longhand solutions, and then presents finite element solutions for the same applications, comparing both. The book is prepared with ABAQUS{\textregistered} software applications to enable a range of readers to experiment firsthand with the principles described in the book (the software application files are available under "student resources" at www.wiley.com/college/helwany). By presenting both the traditional solutions alongside the FEM solutions, Applied Soil Mechanics with ABAQUS{\textregistered} Applications is an ideal introduction to traditional soil mechanics and a guide to alternative solutions and emergent methods.

abstract = {In this study, receiver function analysis is carried out at 32 broadband stations spread all over the Gujarat region, located in the western part of India to image the sedimentary structure and investigate the crustal composition for the entire region. The powerful Genetic Algorithm technique is applied to the receiver functions to derive S-velocity structure beneath each site. A detail image in terms of basement depths and Moho thickness for the entire Gujarat region is obtained for the first time. Gujarat comprises of three distinct regions: Kachchh, Saurashtra and Mainland. In Kachchh region, depth of the basement varies from around 1.5. km in the eastern part to 6. km in the western part and around 2-3. km in the northern part to 4-5. km in the southern part. In the Saurashtra region, there is not much variation in the depth of the basement and is between 3. km and 4. km. In Gujarat mainland part, the basement depth is 5-8. km in the Cambay basin and western edge of Narmada basin. In other parts of the mainland, it is 3-4. km. The depth of Moho beneath each site is obtained using stacking algorithm approach. The Moho is at shallower depth (26-30. km) in the western part of Kachchh region. In the eastern part and epicentral zone of the 2001 Bhuj earthquake, large variation in the Moho depths is noticed (36-46. km). In the Saurashtra region, the crust is more thick in the northern part. It varies from 36-38. km in the southern part to 42-44. km in the northern part. In the mainland region, the crust is more thick (40-44. km) in the northern and southern part and is shallow in Cambay and Narmada basins (32-36. km). The large variations of Poisson's ratio across Gujarat region may be interpreted as heterogeneity in crustal composition. High values of $\sigma$ ({\~{}}0.30) at many sites in Kachchh and few sites in Saurashtra and Mainland regions may be related to the existence of high-velocity lower crust with a mafic/ultramafic composition and, locally, to the presence of partial melt. The existing tectono-sedimentary models proposed by various researchers were also examined.},

abstract = {Earthquakes are known to have occurred in Indian subcontinent from ancient times. This paper presents the results of seismic hazard analysis of India (6°-38°N and 68°-98°E) based on the deterministic approach using latest seismicity data (up to 2010). The hazard analysis was done using two different source models (linear sources and point sources) and 12 well recognized attenuation relations considering varied tectonic provinces in the region. The earthquake data obtained from different sources were homogenized and declustered and a total of 27,146 earthquakes of moment magnitude 4 and above were listed in the study area. The sesismotectonic map of the study area was prepared by considering the faults, lineaments and the shear zones which are associated with earthquakes of magnitude 4 and above. A new program was developed in MATLAB for smoothing of the point sources. For assessing the seismic hazard, the study area was divided into small grids of size 0.1° × 0.1° (approximately 10 × 10 km), and the hazard parameters were calculated at the center of each of these grid cells by considering all the seismic sources within a radius of 300 to 400 km. Rock level peak horizontal acceleration (PHA) and spectral accelerations for periods 0.1 and 1 s have been calculated for all the grid points with a deterministic approach using a code written in MATLAB. Epistemic uncertainty in hazard definition has been tackled within a logic-tree framework considering two types of sources and three attenuation models for each grid point. The hazard evaluation without logic tree approach also has been done for comparison of the results. The contour maps showing the spatial variation of hazard values are presented in the paper. {\textcopyright} Indian Academy of Sciences.},

abstract = {A multitude of observations suggest neotectonic deformation in and around India, but its causes and history are unknown. We use a 2 dimensional finite element model with heterogeneous elastic strengths in continental regions to model the regional stress field orientation and relative magnitudes since the Oligocene. The large-scale geological structure of India is embedded in our model by using published outlines of cratons, fold belts and basins, associated with estimates of their relative strengths, enabling the modelling of stress field deflections along interfaces between relatively strong and weak tectonic elements through time. At 33Ma a roughly NNW-SSE oriented band of relatively high maximum horizontal compressive stress (S{\textless}inf{\textgreater}Hmax{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) straddled India's west coast, while India's east coast and the adjacent Wharton Basin were characterized by relatively low intraplate stresses. Between 20Ma and the present growing collisional boundary forces combined with maturing mid-ocean ridge flanks result in the establishment of an arcuate belt with anomalously high intraplate stress that stretches from India to the Wharton Basin, intersecting the continental shelf roughly orthogonally and crossing the 85° East and Ninetyeast ridges. This results in a compressive tectonic regime favouring folding and inversion northeast of the Godavari Graben on India's east coast, as observed in seismic reflection data, whereas no tectonic reactivation is observed on the continental margin further north, closer to the Mahanadi Graben, or further south. Our stress models account for these differences via spatial variations in modelled horizontal stress magnitudes and intersection angles between margin-paralleling pre-existing basement structures and the evolving Neogene stress field. The models further account for fracture zone strike-slip reactivation offshore Sumatra and lithospheric folding along India's west and southeast coast and can be used to estimate the onset of these deformation episodes to at least the Oligocene and Miocene, respectively.},

abstract = {We consider two-dimensional thermo-chemical mantle convection models to investigate the deformation of the continental lithosphere that follows the oceanic lithosphere into the subduction zone. The models account for the compositional buoyancy forces by considering lithospheric plates with distinct crustal layers. Continental convergence results in crust-mantle detachment in the subducting plate and crustal thickening in both subducting and overriding plates. The depth of detachment ranges from 90 to 200 km, depending on the strength of the lithosphere and the density of the continental crust. As the crust thickens, the convergence velocity in the collision zone decreases and the locus of subduction gradually shifts toward the interior of the subducting plate. In models with greater viscosity, the subducting mantle lithosphere maintains its integrity and does not break up. In models with weaker rheology, the positive buoyancy of the thickened crust can overcome the strength of the subducting lithosphere, and causes the oceanic slab to break off and sink into the mantle. The breakoff occurs over a time interval of 10-20 million years, which is roughly the time needed for the crust to reach its maximum thickness. Crustal detachment takes place over a wide range of lithospheric strength, suggesting that crustal buoyancy has an important role in the dynamics of continental subduction. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here we demonstrate the role of extrinsic processes consequent to intrinsic processes as a catalyst for anomalous rapid plate movement. The rapid and accelerated flight of the Indian subcontinent since Deccan volcanism until its collision with Eurasia remains as one of the geological conundrums. Data on seismic tomography, peninsular geomorphology and inferences on continuum of subcrustal structures are utilized to address this enigma. We propose geomorphic isostasy as the mechanism that has driven this fastest drift ever recorded in geological history. It was initiated by sudden instability after the Deccan volcanism and resultant extensive accumulation of lava pile over continental lithosphere of northern India, northern-eastern tilt due to crustal thickness heterogeneity and subcrustal thermal stratification. The drift was sustained by Carlsberg and Central Indian ridge-push until collision and sediment top loading at northeast thenceforth. These inferences and geomorphic isostasy as a catalytic mechanism necessitate variability of drift rates as integral inputs for any continental scale modeling.},

The displacements of the solid phase, the pressure of the wetting phase and the capillary pressure are taken as the primary unknowns of the present formulation. The other variables are incorporated into the model using the experimentally determined functions that define the relationship between the hydraulic properties of the porous medium, i.e. saturation, relative permeability and capillary pressure. It is worth mentioning that the imposition of various boundary conditions is feasible notwithstanding the choice of the primary variables. The modified Pastor-Zienkiewicz generalized constitutive model is introduced into the mathematical formulation to simulate the mechanical behavior of the unsaturated soil. The accuracy of the proposed mathematical model for analyzing coupled fluid flows in porous media is verified by the resolution of several numerical examples for which previous solutions are known. Finally, the performance of the computational algorithm in modeling of large-scale porous media problems including the large elasto-plastic deformations is demonstrated through the fully coupled analysis of the failure of two earth and rockfill dams. Furthermore, the three-phase model is compared to its simplified one which simulates the unsaturated porous medium as a two-phase one with static air phase. The paper illustrates the shortcomings of the commonly used simplified approach in the context of seismic analysis of two earth and rockfill dams. It is shown that accounting the pore air as an independent phase significantly influences the unsaturated soil behavior. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The origin of the Central Mexican Volcanic Belt (CMVB) and the influence of the subducting Cocos plate on the CMVB volcanism are still controversial. In this study, the temperature and mantle wedge flow models for the Mexican subduction zone are developed using the finite element method to investigate the thermal structure below CMVB. The numerical scheme solves a system of 2D Stokes equations and 2D steady-state heat transfer equation. Two models are considered for the mantle wedge: the first one with an isoviscous mantle wedge and the second one with strong temperature-dependent viscosity. The first model reveals a maximum temperature of ∼830 °C in the mantle wedge, which is not sufficient for melting of wet peridotite. Also, the geotherm of the subducting plate upper surface does not intersect the dehydration-melting solidus for mafic minerals. The second model predicts temperatures of more than 1200 °C beneath the CMVB for a wide range of rheological parameters (reference viscosity and activation energy). Up to 0.6 wt.{\%} H2O can be released down to 60 km depth through metamorphic changes in the oceanic crust of the subducting slab. The melting of this oceanic crust apparently occurs in a narrow depth range of 50-60 km and also melting of the mantle wedge hydrated peridotite is now expected to take place beneath CMVB. Considering that the melting processes on and in the vicinity of the subducting plate surface generate the most of the volcanic material, a dynamic model for the blob tracers is developed using Stokes flow at infinite Prandtl number. The blobs of 0.2-10.0 km in diameter migrate along very different trajectories only at low wrapping viscosities ($\eta$w = 1014-5 × 1017 Pa s). The modeling results show that the "fast" trajectories terminate at the same focus location at the base of the continental crust, while the arrival points of "slow" trajectories, which are common for the blobs of smaller size (∼0.4-0.5 km), are scattered away from the average focus location. This observation may give us a hint on a possible mechanism of strato and mono volcanoes genesis. The rise time, which the blob detached from the subducted plate, needs to reach the bottom of the continental crust, is from 0.001 up to 14 million years depending on the blob diameter and surrounding viscosity. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Results show significant variations of thickness, shear velocities (Vs) and Vp/Vs ratio in the crust of the study region. The inverted shear wave velocity models show crustal thickness variations of 32–36 km in Shillong Plateau (North), 36–40 in Assam Valley and ∼44 km in Lesser Himalaya (South). Average Vp/Vs ratio in Shillong Plateau is less (1.73–1.77) compared to Assam Valley and Lesser Himalaya (∼1.80). Average crustal shear velocity beneath the study region varies from 3.4 to 3.5 km/s. Sediment structure beneath Shillong Plateau and Assam Valley shows 1–2 km thick sediment layer with low Vs (2.5–2.9 km/s) and high Vp/Vs ratio (1.8–2.1), while it is observed to be of greater thickness (4 km) with similar Vs and high Vp/Vs (∼2.5) in RUP (Lesser Himalaya). Both Shillong Plateau and Assam Valley show thick upper and middle crust (10–20 km), and thin (4–9 km) lower crust. Average Vp/Vs ratio in Assam Valley and Shillong Plateau suggest that the crust is felsic-to-intermediate and intermediate-to-mafic beneath Shillong Plateau and Assam Valley, respectively. Results show that lower crust rocks beneath the Shillong Plateau and Assam Valley lies between mafic granulite and mafic garnet granulite.},

The FEMs are used to compute a coefficient matrix relating displacements at observation points due to unit dislocations of contact-node pairs on the fault surface. The Green's function responses are used to solve the inverse problem of estimating dislocation distributions from coseismic GPS displacements. Predictions from the FEM with heterogeneous material properties, loaded with either of the HEHS dislocation distributions, significantly overestimate coseismic displacements. Postseismic deformation predictions are also sensitive to the coseismic dislocation distribution, which drives poroelastic and viscoelastic relaxation. FEM-generated Green's functions, which allow for spatial variations in material properties, are thus preferable to those that assume a simple HEHS because the latter leads to dislocation distributions unsuitable for predicting the postseismic response.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature. The strength and deformation characteristics of rocks are the most important mechanical properties for rock engineering constructions. A new nonlinear strength criterion is developed for rocks by combining the Hoek–Brown (HB) criterion and the nonlinear unified strength criterion (NUSC). The proposed criterion takes account of the intermediate principal stress effect against HB criterion, as well as being nonlinear in the meridian plane against NUSC. Only three parameters are required to be determined by experiments, including the two HB parameters $\sigma$c and mi. The failure surface of the proposed criterion is continuous, smooth and convex. The proposed criterion fits the true triaxial test data well and performs better than the other three existing criteria. Then, by introducing the Geological Strength Index, the proposed criterion is extended to rock masses and predicts the test data well. Finally, based on the proposed criterion, a triaxial elasto-plastic damage model for intact rock is developed. The plastic part is based on the effective stress, whose yield function is developed by the proposed criterion. For the damage part, the evolution function is assumed to have an exponential form. The performance of the constitutive model shows good agreement with the results of experimental tests.},

abstract = {Aeromagnetic data analysis over the Narmada-Son Lineament (NSL) shows that prominent anomalies are located over dyke swarms and trap flows and the major formations present have distinct magnetic signatures. A major extensive ENE fault is identified which coincides with the course of the Narmada river and which appears, as earlier suggested, to control Gondwana sedimentation to the south and Vindhyan sedimentation to the north. By isolating the sources, it is found that the signatures of the Deccan traps have a distribution that is possibly related to their time of eruption and subsequent evolution. The region between Hoshangabad (HBD) and Narsimapura (NSR) are made up of two structural units: a shallow ENE structure superposed on a deeper NW-SE feature which is possibly related to the continuation of the Godavari Gondwana Graben towards the northwest. The region north and south of the deep-seated fault F1 has undergone different evolutionary history. The thickness of the magnetic crust in the Narmada-Son region lies between 25 to 31 km, implying a lithological change below this depth. This is borne out by the high velocity layer (7.2 km/s) within the lower crust identified by DSS studies.

abstract = {The record of earthquakes in India is patchy prior to 1800 and its improvement is much impeded by its dispersal in a dozen local languages, and several colonial archives. Although geological studies will necessarily complement the historical record, only two earthquakes of the dozens of known historical events have resulted in surface ruptures, and it is likely that geological data in the form of liquefaction features will be needed to extend the historical record beyond the most recent few centuries. Damage from large Himalayan earthquakes recorded in Tibet and in Northern India suggests that earthquakes may attain M = 8.2. Seismic gaps along two-thirds of the Himalaya that have developed in the past five centuries, when combined with geodetic convergence rates of approximately 1.8 m/cy, suggests that one or more M = 8 earthquakes may be overdue. The mechanisms of recent earthquakes in Peninsular India are consistent with stresses induced in the Indian plate flexed by its collision with Tibet. A region of abnormally high seismicity in western India appears to be caused by local convergence across the Rann of Kachchh and possibly other rift zones of India. Since the plate itself deforms little, this deformation may be related to incipient plate fragmentation in Sindh or over a larger region of NW India.},

abstract = {Even though a multitude of observations suggest time-dependent regional tectonic reactivation of the Australian Plate, its large-scale intraplate stress field evolution remains largely unexplored. This arises because intraplate paleo-stress models are difficult to construct, and that observations of tectonic reactivation are often hard to date. However, because the Australian plate has undergone significant changes in plate boundary types and geometries since the Cretaceous, we argue that even simple models can provide some insights into the nature and timing of crustal reactivation through time. We present Australian intraplate stress models for key times from the Early Cretaceous to the present, and link them to geological observations for evaluating time-dependent fault reactivation. We focus on the effect time-dependent geometries of mid-ocean ridges, subduction zones and collisional plate boundaries around Australia have on basin evolution and fault reactivation through time by reconstructing tectonic plates, restoring plate boundary configurations, and modelling the effect of selected time-dependent plate driving forces on the intraplate stress field of a rheologically heterogeneous plate. We compare mapped fault reactivation histories with paleo-stress models via time-dependent fault slip tendency analysis employing Coulomb-Navier criteria to determine the likelihood of strain in a body of rock being accommodated by sliding along pre-existing planes of weakness. This allows us to reconstruct the dominant regional deformation regime (reverse, normal or strike-slip) through time. Our models illustrate how the complex interplay between juxtaposed weak and strong geological plate elements and changes in far-field plate boundary forces have caused intraplate orogenesis and/or tectonic reactivation in basins and fold belts throughout Australia. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

The strain rate curves for the Indian plate indicate interference of two different orders of deformation. The magnitudes of the first-order maximum strain rates are lower than local extreme strain rates of the second-order deformation. It has been shown herein that the oblique motion of the Indian plate with respect to a state of dominant strike-slip deformation in the Indian plate interior is partitioned into a principal deformation zone, synthetic shear and antithetic shear. The strain rates along these regional shear zones show complex association of second-order high shortening rate coinciding with high extension rate. The earthquakes of the Indian plate interior are interpreted to be results of periodic accumulation of stress/strain due to shortening and release of strain along the same directions during the extension. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Most site response studies are carried out by considering a set of existing shear modulus and damping curves, without knowing its suitability for the in situ soil type. In this study, an attempt has been made to identify suitable shear modulus and damping curves for soil grouped into different classes viz. sand, gravel and rock. Soil profiles of sites having surface and bedrock motion recordings are selected from the KiK-Net downhole array database and equivalent linear and total stress nonlinear site response analysis has been carried out by varying the shear modulus and damping curves for different sites. Estimated surface response spectra for each set of shear modulus and damping curves are compared with the observed response spectra at each site, and a detailed analysis is made to find out which set of curves gives a best match with the recorded data. Based on this study, representative property curves for rock, gravel and sand are suggested, which could be used for further site response studies in the region. This study shows that only a set of shear modulus and damping curves ensure a compatible spectrum with the recorded data from the KiK-Net downhole array sites, among the many available shear modulus and damping curves in the literature.},

abstract = {We develop a new dynamic earthquake simulator to numerically simulate both spontaneous rupture and aseismic slip over earthquake cycles on geometrically complex fault systems governed by rate-and state-dependent friction. The method is based on the dynamic finite-element method (FEM) EQdyna, which is directly used in the simulator for modeling 3D spontaneous rupture. We apply an adaptive dynamic relaxation technique and a variable time stepping scheme to EQdyna to model the quasi-static processes of an earthquake cycle, including the postseismic, interseismic, and nucleation processes. Therefore, the dynamic and quasi-static processes of an earthquake cycle are modeled in one FEM framework. Tests on a vertical strike-slip fault verify the correctness of the dynamic sim-ulator. We apply the simulator to thrust faults with various dipping angles, which can be considered as the simplest case of geometrically complex faults by breaking symmetry, compared with vertical faults, to examine effects of dipping fault geometry on earthquake cycle behaviors. We find that shallower dipping thrust faults produce larger seismic slip and longer recurrence time over earthquake cycles with the same rupture area. In addition, we find an empirically linear scaling relation between the recurrence interval (and the seismic moment) and the sinusoidal function of the dip angle. The dip-angle dependence is likely due to the free-surface effect, because of broken symmetry. These results suggest dynamic earthquake simulators that can handle nonvertical dipping fault geometry are needed for subduction-zone earthquake studies.},

abstract = {A new plate model is used to analyze the mean seismicities of seven types of plate boundary (CRB, continental rift boundary; CTF, continental transform fault; CCB, continental convergent boundary; OSR, oceanic spreading ridge; OTF, oceanic transform fault; OCB, oceanic convergent boundary; SUB, subduction zone). We compare the platelike (nonorogen) regions of model PB2002 (Bird, 2003) with the centroid moment tensor (CMT) catalog to select apparent boundary half-widths and then assign 95{\%} of shallow earthquakes to one of these settings. A tapered Gutenberg-Richter model of the frequency/moment relation is fit to the subcatalog for each setting by maximum likelihood. Best-fitting $\beta$ values range from 0.53 to 0.92, but all 95{\%} confidence ranges are consistent with a common value of 0.61-0.66. To better determine some corner magnitudes we expand the subcatalogs by (1) inclusion of orogens and (2) inclusion of years 1900-1975 from the catalog of Pacheco and Sykes (1992). Combining both earthquake statistics and the plate-tectonic constraint on moment rate, corner magnitudes include the following: CRB, 7.64-0.26+0.76; CTF, 8.01-0.21+0.47; CCB, 8.460.39-0.21; OCB, 8.04-0.22+0.52; and SUB, 9.58-0.46+0.48. Coupled lithosphere thicknesses are found to be the following: CRB, 3.0-1.4+7.0; CTF 8.6-4-11; CCB, 18-11+?; OSR, 0.13-0.09+0.13 for normal faulting and 0.40-0.21+? for strike slip; OTF, 13-7.3+?, 1.8-0.5-1.1, and 1.6-0.5+1.1 at low, medium, and high velocities; OCB, 3.8-2.3+13.7; and SUB, 18.0-10.8+?. In general, high coupling of subduction and continental plate boundaries suggests that here all seismic gaps are dangerous unless proven to be creeping. In general, low coupling within oceanic lithosphere, suggests a different model of isolated seismic fault patches surrounded by large seismic gaps that may be permanent.

abstract = {We present crustal thickness and Poisson's ratio determinations from receiver function analyzes at 32 sites on the Archaean and Proterozoic terrains of South India. The crustal thickness in the late Archaean (2.5 Ga) Eastern Dharwar Craton varies from 34-39 km. Similar crustal thickness is observed beneath the Deccan Volcanic Province and the Cuddapah basin. The most unexpected result is the anomalous present-day crustal thickness of 42-51 km beneath the mid-Archaean (3.4-3.0 Ga) segment of the Western Dharwar Craton. Since the amphibolite-grade metamorphic mineral assemblages (5-7 Kbar paleopressures) in this part of Western Dharwar Craton equilibrated at the depths of 15-20 km, our observations suggest the existence of an exceptionally thick (57-70 km) crust 3.0 Ga ago. Beneath the exhumed granulite terrain in southernmost India, the crustal thickness varies between 42-60 km. The Poisson's ratio ranges between 0.24-0.28 beneath the Precambrian terrains, indicating the presence of intermediate rock type in the lower crust. These observations of thickened crust suggest significant crustal shortening in South India during the Archaean.},

abstract = {The interseismic deformation associated with plate coupling at a subduction zone is commonly simulated by the steady-slip model in which a reverse dip-slip is imposed on the down-dip extension of the locked plate interface, or by the backslip model in which a normal slip is imposed on the locked plate interface. It is found that these two models, although totally different in principle, produce similar patterns for the vertical deformation at a subduction zone. This suggests that it is almost impossible to distinguish between these two models by analysing only the interseismic vertical deformation observed at a subduction zone.  The steady-slip model cannot correctly predict the horizontal deformation associated with plate coupling at a subduction zone, a fact that is proved by both the numerical modelling in this study and the GPS (Global Positioning System) observations near the Nankai trough, southwest Japan. It is therefore inadequate to simulate the effect of the plate coupling at a subduction zone by the steady-slip model. It is also revealed that the unphysical assumption inherent in the backslip model of imposing a normal slip on the locked plate interface makes it impossible to predict correctly the horizontal motion of the subducted plate and the stress change within the overthrust zone associated with the plate coupling during interseismic stages. If the analysis made in this work is proved to be correct, some of the previous studies on interpreting the interseismic deformation observed at several subduction zones based on these two models might need substantial revision.  On the basis of the investigations on plate interaction at subduction zones made using the finite element method and the kinematic/mechanical conditions of the plate coupling implied by the present plate tectonics, a synthesized model is proposed to simulate the kinematic effect of the plate interaction during interseismic stages. A numerical analysis shows that the proposed model, designed to simulate the motion of a subducted slab, can correctly produce the deformation and the main pattern of stress concentration associated with plate coupling at a subduction zone. The validity of the synthesized model is examined and partially verified by analysing the horizontal deformation observed by GPS near the Nankai trough, southwest Japan.},

Based on our results, the viscosities of the low velocity zone at a depth of ∼25 km and of the middle and lower crust around the Longmenshan Thrust Belt are obtained as 2.75×10 17 Pa{\textperiodcentered}s and 2.56×10 18 Pa{\textperiodcentered}s, respectively. The post-seismic rebound, which was observed near the Lushan epicenter, may represent the occurrence of overslip during the earthquake. The more complex structural style may have produced weaker fault activity along the southern segment of the Longmenshan Thrust Belt than along its middle and northern segments.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the axial load transfer during seismic events for pile groups installed in loose and dense sand layers. The analysis was conducted employing three-dimensional (3D) nonlinear finite element models (FEM) that were validated using the results from shaking table tests of a model superstructure supported by a pile group installed in saturated (liquefiable) and dry (non-liquefiable) soil profiles. The FEM was employed to explore the axial load transfer at the liquefiable and non-liquefiable tests. The results of the liquefiable test demonstrated that the excess pore water pressure and associated liquefaction during the shaking caused dramatic decrease in the shaft friction resistance. Nonetheless, positive shaft friction was observed through the loose sand layer until the soil becomes fully liquefied. In addition, the end bearing forces decreased dramatically, and the pile exhibited excessive settlement, which mobilized additional end bearing resistance. At the non-liquefiable test, the pile experienced compression and tension loading cycles, but the loads were less than its static capacity. The effects of ground motion intensity, pile diameter, and thickness of the loose sand layer on the load transfer mechanism were also evaluated. It was found that as the pile diameter increased, higher excess pore water pressure developed in the dense sand, which reduced the bearing pressure. Also, as expected, the reduction in shaft resistance was higher as the thickness of the loose (liquefiable) sand layer increased, especially for piles with a small diameter. For the non-liquefiable soil, the strain in the soil increased for larger pile diameters, and consequently, the bearing forces decreased but later increased as the pile settlement mobilized higher resistance.},

abstract = {The Indian subcontinent comprises geological terranes of varied age and structural character. In this study, we provide new constraints to existing crustal models by inverting the P-to-s receiver functions (RFs) at 317 broadband seismic stations. Inversion results fill crucial gaps in existing velocity models (CRUST1.0 and SEAPS) by capturing regions which are less represented. The final model produced is much more heterogeneous and is able to capture the structural variations between closely spaced seismic stations. In comparison to the global models, major differences are seen for seismic stations located over various rift zones (e.g., Godavari, Narmada, and Cambay) and those close to the coastal regions where transition from oceanic to continental crust is expected to create drastic changes in the crustal configuration. Seismic images are produced along various profiles using 49,682 individual RFs recorded at 442 seismic stations. Lateral variations captured using migrated images across the Himalayan collisional front revealed the hitherto elusive southern extent of the Moho and intracrustal features south of the Main Central Thrust (MCT). Poisson's ratio and crustal thickness estimates obtained using H-k stacking technique and inversion of RFs are grossly similar lending credence to the robustness of inversions. An updated crustal thickness map produced using 1,525 individual data points from controlled source seismics and RFs reveals a (a) thickened crust ({\textgreater}55 km) at the boundary of Dharwar Craton and Southern Granulite Terrain, (b) clear difference in crustal thickness estimates between Eastern Dharwar Craton and Western Dharwar Craton, (c) thinner crust beneath Cambay Basin between southwest Deccan Volcanic Province and Delhi-Aravalli Fold Belt, (d) thinner crust ({\textless}35 km) beneath Bengal Basin, (e) thicker crust ({\textgreater}40 km) beneath paleorift zones like Narmada Son Lineament and Godavari Graben, and (f) very thick crust beneath central Tibet ({\textgreater}65 km) with maximum lateral variations along the Himalayan collision front.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

It is indispensable to analyse seismic hazard as the region is considered to be most seismically active in stable continental region of India. The Bhuj earthquake of 2001 has caused extensive damage in terms of causality and economic loss. In the present study, the seismic hazard of Gujarat evaluated using a probabilistic approach with the use of logic tree framework that minimizes the uncertainties in hazard assessment. The peak horizontal acceleration (PHA) and spectral acceleration (Sa) values were evaluated for 10 and 2 {\%} probability of exceedance in 50 years. Two important geotechnical effects of earthquakes, site amplification and liquefaction, are also evaluated, considering site characterization based on site classes. The liquefaction return period for the entire state of Gujarat is evaluated using a performance-based approach.

abstract = {Cosmetic products are generally formulated as emulsions, ointments, solutions or powders containing active ingredients. According to EU legislation, a cosmetic product is "any substance or preparation intended to be placed in contact with the various external parts of the human body with a view exclusively or mainly to cleaning, perfuming them, changing their appearance, and/or correcting body odors and/or protecting them or keeping them in good conditions". However, science advancement in both active carriers and ingredients has streamlined the process through which many cosmetic products by their delivery systems can induce modifications on the skin physiology. This is the reason why Reed and Kligman redefined these products as "cosmeceuticals", which refers to the combination of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Until recently, the term of cosmeceuticals has not had legal significance. The so-called cosmeceuticals, in fact, may induce modifications on the skin physiology, modifying, for example, transepidermal water loss, keratinocytes cohesion and turnover, modulating the inflammatory cascade, and/or altering the surface microbiota by the activity of the preservatives content. For these reasons, they are claimed to have medical or drug-like benefits. Naturally, their effectiveness on minor skin disorders or mild skin abnormalities has to be shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. On the other hand, their formulations contain emulsifiers, preservatives, and other chemicals which, by their cumulative use, may provoke side effects, such as allergic and/or sensitization phenomena. Moreover, many ingredients and packaging for such products are not biodegradable. In this study, we would like to introduce an innovative category of cosmeceuticals made by biodegradable nonwoven tissues. These cosmeceutical tissues, produced through the use of natural fibers, may bind different active ingredients and therefore become effective as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, sun-protective, whitening, or anti-aging products, depending on the ingredient(s) used. Differently from the usual cosmetics, they do not contain preservatives, emulsifiers, colors, and other chemicals. They can be applied as dried tissue on wet skin, remaining in loco for around 30 min, slowly releasing the active ingredients entrapped into the fibers. It is interesting to underline that the tissue, acting as a carrier, has its own effectiveness via chitin and lignin polymers with an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. When hydrolyzed by the human microbiota enzymes, they give rise to ingredients used as cell nourishment or energy. This paper will review part of the scientific research results, supporting this new category of biodegradable cosmetic products known as facial mask sheets.},

abstract = {We estimate receiver functions (RFs) through the time-domain deconvolution using three-component broadband data of 100 teleseismic events (30° ⩽ ∧ ⩽ 90°) from 15 seismographs in the eastern Indian craton. Estimated radial RFs show a positive phase at 4.6–5.8 s delay time corresponding to the crustal thicknesses of 37–46 km. Through the differential evolution (DE) waveform inversion modeling of radial receiver functions, we delineate the crustal structure at 15 broadband stations. On an average, the Archean Singhbhum Odisha Craton (SOC) is characterized by a thick crust of 43 ± 3 km in comparison to a relatively thin crust of 41 ± 1 km underlying the Proterozoic Chotanagpur Granite Gneissic terrain (CGGT). While, a thin crust of 38 ± 1 km characterizes the younger Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt (EGMB). The main results of our modeling reveal a 46 km thick Archean crust underlying the Singhbhum granite (SG) of 3.6 Ga, which is characterized by a 3 km crustal thickening probably resulted from the Archean subduction process. Our modeling also detects a 2–3 km crustal thinning with the thinnest crust of 37 km below the region near South Singhbhum Shear Zone, which could be attributed to the 1.6 Ga plume activity associated with Dalma volcanic. Our modeling also led to the delineation of a crustal thinning of 2–3 km underlying the region in EGMB, which was influenced by a much younger (∼117 Ma) Rajmahal magmatism associated with the Gondwana break-up episode. However, our study could not detect any age-dependent variation of crustal thicknesses in the eastern Indian craton. The main result of our modeling suggests a two-phase crustal evolution process for the SOC viz. older E-W crustal thickening due to E-W plate compression and later crustal thinning episodes associated with the Dalma volcanism in the north and the Rajmahal volcanism in the South.},

abstract = {The effect of temperature and pressure, which play important roles in the mechanical properties of rocks during deep energy exploitation, has not been sufficiently studied in the previous rock creep models. In order to investigate thermal effect in creep models, a modified Nishihara rheological model, taking into account the coupled effect of thermal damage and stress, was proposed by combining the theoretical formula for thermal damage of rocks with the modified Nishihara model. The improved model introduces a nonlinear viscous dashpot, which can accurately describe the accelerated rheological phase of rocks. To verify the proposed model, a triaxial rheological experiment was conducted on sandstone subjected to thermal damage (600°C). In addition, the stress-strain curves within whole creep process of the rheological experiment were analyzed. Furthermore, the theoretical curves of the modified Nishihara rheological model were compared with the experimental results. Results showed that the theoretical curves relatively agree well with the experimental data, suggesting that the proposed new model is more preferred to describing the rheological curve of sandstone subjected to thermal damage at different rheological stages, in particular, it is capable of depicting the accelerated rheological stage of the sandstone, providing a good ability to describe the creep behavior of rocks under thermal-mechanical coupling.},

abstract = {Contemporary deformation of the Cascadia forearc consists of an elastic interseismic strain build-up as part of the subduction earthquake deformation "cycle" and a secular deformation primarily in the form of are-parallel translation and clockwise rotation of forearc blocks. A th ree-dimensional (3-D) elastic dislocation model, constrained by vertical deformation data, was developed previously to study the interseismic deformation. In this study, we develop a 3-D viscoelastic finite element model for the Cascadia subduction zone to study the temporal and spatial variations of interseismic deformation, and we compare the model results primarily with horizontal geodetic deformation observations. The model has an elastic lithosphere/slab and a viscoelastic mantle which has a viscosity of 10(19) Pa s as constrained by recent postglacial rebound analyses. For comparison, we adopt a seismogenic zone geometry that was used in the previous elastic dislocation model, and we test the effects of different estimates of relative plate motion on the model predictions. Interseismic deformation is simulated by assigning a backslip rate to the locked zone of the subduction fault, preceded by an earthquake rupture of the same zone. Based on preliminary model results, we draw the following conclusions: (1) The deformation rate decreases through the interseismic period. A seaward motion is predicted for inland sites early in the interseismic period, an effect of postseismic creep of the mantle. (2) Model strain rates 300 years after the earthquake are consistent with the observed values, regardless of the plate motion models used. The horizontal velocities in northern Cascadia decrease landward at a slower rate than predicted by the elastic dislocation model, providing a better fit to observations. (3) Oblique subduction causes strain partitioning. As a result, the direction of local maximum contraction is much less oblique than plate convergence. The northerly direction of the GPS velocities in southern Cascadia represent a northward translation of the forearc. The secular deformation of the forearc may be partially accommodated through earthquake deformation cycles, but it may be better modeled as a process independent of the earthquake cycle.},

abstract = {Triaxial unloading creep tests of layered rock specimen of Jinping II hydropower station were carried out using the rock creep testing machine; thus the creep deformation curves under different confining pressures were acquired. The test results showed that, in addition to the obvious unloading creep characteristics of rock specimen, the nonlinear accelerating creep deformation emerged under the last stage confining stress condition, and the whole creep curves presented the typical rock creep three stages. On the other hand, the Burgers creep model constitutive equations under the three-dimensional stress state were also deduced. Based on the creep test data, through identifying the creep parameters using the optimized algorithm, the corresponding parameters of triaxial creep constitutive model were obtained. By comparative analysis of creep parameters, it can be concluded that creep parameters nonlinearly degraded with the decrease of confining pressure gradually. Moreover, when the load is below the long-term strength of rock, the creep parameters are only related to the unloading ratio, while in the case that the load is larger than the long-term strength of rock, the unloading creep parameters are related to both unloading ratio and creep time. According to the creep parameters under the first-stage stress level, and through introducing unloading ratio damage factor to describe the degrading rule of creep parameters on other stress levels, the method of uniformity determining the creep parameters was proposed. It was assumed that the damage degree in rock interior was relative to both unloading ratio and creep time; a nonlinear creep damage model of rock under unloading was proposed, which could better reflect the nonlinear characteristics of rock creep. The results showed that rock nonlinear creep damage model achieved perfectly consistent results with the creep test.},

abstract = {Investigation of large scale suture zones in old continental interiors offers insights into the evolution of continents. The Dharwar Craton (DC) and the Southern Granulite Terrain(SGT) of the Indian shield represent large segments of Precambrian middle to lower crust and preserve a geological record spanning from Mesoarchean to Cambrian. This study illuminates the deep structure of the Palghat-Cauvery Shear Zone System (PCSS) and the Palghat-Cauvery Suture Zone (PCSZ) that comprise crustal-scale structures related to multiple episodes of orogeny, crust formation and reworking. We utilize here 3202 high quality P-receiver functions computed using new data from a 23 station seismic network operated by us. Results show a thick ({\textgreater}38 km) mafic (Poisson's ratio {\textgreater}0.25) crust beneath the SGT. The change in crustal thickness is gradual, with a shallower Moho towards the south of PCSZ. We found little evidence for drastic changes in crustal thickness across prominent shear zones like the PCSZ and Moyar-Bhavani. Few seismic stations located along these boundaries have shown evidence for dipping reflectors around 8–20 km depth, with strikes matching well with the trends of surface geological sutures. We opine that these suture zones do not show indications of a terrane boundary. However, a drastic change in the crustal thickness is observed around the prograde metamorphic transition zone or broadly, the “Fermor line”, which separates rocks of Chanockitic (Orthopyroxene bearing granitoid) and non-Charnockitic (Orthopyroxene-free granitoid) mineral assemblage, further north beneath the DC. We suggest that thicknening of crust north of Moyar-Attur Shear Zone (MASZ) and around Fermor line is related to subduction processes operative during the Precambrian.},

@article{Goetze1979,
abstract = {Summary. Previous attempts to deduce the stress distribution in the bending lithosphere near a consuming plate margin have relied on the observed bathymetry and an assumed constitutive relation for lithospheric behaviour, e.g. perfectly elastic, viscous/perfectly plastic, or elastic perfectly plastic. From the point of view of rock mechanics, each of these approximations fails to describe one or more of several basic phenomena, including brittle failure of rock, temperature dependence of elasticity, and temperature and/or strain rate dependence of ductile behaviour. In order to formulate a more realistic constitutive relation, a limiting yield strength curve, which is primarily a function of temperature, is constructed from data from brittle failure and ductile flow experiments. The moments which can be supported by plates with this constitutive behaviour are compared to the moments calculated from bathymetric profiles. The comparison indicates that moments required by the bathymetric data are consistent with moments supported by plates with experimentally determined constitutive laws as extrapolated to geologically reasonable temperatures and strain rates. The stresses developed in such models are required to reach values greater than 100 MPa† in the depth range 25–45 km. Geotherms necessary for strength curves consistent with moments calculated from the bathymetric data match those derived from heat flow data for the Aleutian, Bonin, Mariana and Tonga trenches. Of the trenches studied, only the geotherm inferred from the Kuril trench data is significantly different, perhaps implying that the Kuril plate is weaker than the others. The strength curves show that as a first approximation it is better to assume that bending moment is independent of curvature of the plate than to assume that bending moment and curvature are linearly related.

The hot and shallow upper mantle flows by dislocation creep, whereas cold and shallow or deep upper mantle may flow by diffusion creep.

abstract = {The India-Eurasia collision has created high mountains in the Himalayan plate boundary system, which has led to numerous earthquakes in this region and released part of the elastic strain accumulated over years. In this study, the present-day deformation pattern is derived from geodetic mode Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements obtained during 2005–2016 from 16 campaign sites in the Kumaun province of the central Himalaya. GPS derived horizontal velocity vectors are in the range of 1–9 mm/yr and 27–38 mm/yr with respect to stable India and Eurasia reference frames respectively. To understand the interseismic strain partitioning in the study region, we consider the uniform slip dislocation model over the fault in an elastic, isotropic and homogeneous half-space medium. The model indicates the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) fault is locked to a depth of ∼20 km and slips at a rate of 17.2 ± 1 mm/yr with a dip angle of ∼7°. This MHT slip rate build-up corresponds to a moment deficit of 8.4 ± 1 × 10 18 Nm/yr due to locking of the fault beneath the Kumaun Himalaya. The total seismic strain accumulation of 61 × 10 −6 estimated from the geodetic data suggests the possibility of large earthquakes (typically magnitude 8 and above) with the recurrence interval of around 600 years in the Kumaun Himalayan region.},

abstract = {Purpose - According to the traditional "stable-process" problem, the project-based company's memory and project implementation cannot interact. They remain conceptually distinctly different entities, the differences stemming from epistemologically different theoretical projects. However, the idea of recursivity within autopoiesis theory and autopoietic epistemology might enable an approach to this problem by bridging the gap. A recursive view of the project-based company assumes that the memory of the company and the project implementation processes within the company exist at different levels of analysis. They remain analytically distinct from each other, yet they interact in such a way that they are both modified through interaction, Therefore, this paper aims to show that, with the help of a recursive view, it can shed new light on the problem of knowledge production in project-based companies. Design/methodology/approach - Knowledge production in project-based companies is conceptualized with the help of autopoiesis theory and autopoietic epistemology in that the focus is on the recursivity Findings - The idea of recursivity seems to represent explanatory potential by bringing new light to relationships between the project-based company's memory and project implementations. Originality/value - Current theories about knowledge production in project-based companies are largely based on the idea of transferability of knowledge between people and across borders. These theories are challenged by the implications of autopoiesis theory and autopoietic epistemology which suggest transition from these theories to the theory of knowledge production as a creational matter That is, autopoietic epistemology and the recursive view within it provide a lens through which individuals may advance their understanding of the dynamics of project-based companies' knowledge production.},

abstract = {Landslide hazards are a major natural disaster that affects most of the hilly regions around the world. In India, significant damages due to earthquake induced landslides have been reported in the Himalayan region and also in the Western Ghat region. Thus there is a requirement of a quantitative macro-level landslide hazard assessment within the Indian subcontinent in order to identify the regions with high hazard. In the present study, the seismic landslide hazard for the entire state of Karnataka, India was assessed using topographic slope map, derived from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. The available ASTER DEM data, resampled to 50 m resolution, was used for deriving the slope map of the entire state. Considering linear source model, deterministic seismic hazard analysis was carried out to estimate peak horizontal acceleration (PHA) at bedrock, for each of the grid points having terrain angle 10° and above. The surface level PHA was estimated using nonlinear site amplification technique, considering B-type NEHRP site class. Based on the surface level PHA and slope angle, the seismic landslide hazard for each grid point was estimated in terms of the static factor of safety required to resist landslide, using Newmark's analysis. The analysis was carried out at the district level and the landslide hazard map for all the districts in the Karnataka state was developed first. These were then merged together to obtain a quantitative seismic landslide hazard map of the entire state of Karnataka. Spatial variations in the landslide hazard for all districts as well as for the entire state Karnataka is presented in this paper. The present study shows that the Western Ghat region of the Karnataka state is found to have high landslide hazard where the static factor of safety required to resist landslide is very high. {\textcopyright} 2013 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the mechanics of back arc spreading and seismic decoupling. Back arc spreading is assumed to be due to rifting of the upper plate and hence occurs when trench-normal tension reaches a critical value. Seismic decoupling is assumed to occur when the normal stress at the frictional interface is decreased by an amount sufficient to cross the friction stability transition. Two forces are important in this problem. The first is a small component of the slab pull force which remains unbalanced by the subduction resistance and exerts a vertical suction force at the trench. The second is a sea anchor force exerted on the slab that resists its lateral motion, assumed to occur at the upper plate velocity. The model predicts three regimes: seismically coupled compressional arcs with advancing upper plates; seismically decoupled extensional arcs with retreating upper plates, and strongly extensional arcs which also have back arc spreading. This model is applied in detail to the Izu-Bonin-Marianas system. -from Authors},

abstract = {We have developed an elastic finite element model in order to study the role of the different forces acting on the northwestern part of the Central American Volcanic Arc and the Chortis Block. We present synthetic focal mechanisms, maps of tectonic regime, and strain crosses to analyze the results. The models show that to achieve the observed state of stress on the volcanic arc, the arc must be modeled as a lithospheric weak zone. Also, the forces related to the eastward drift of the Caribbean plate must be higher than those related to the subduction of the Cocos plate. The coupling on the subduction interface must be low, with or without slip-partitioning due to the obliquity of the subduction at the trench. At Guatemala the western edge of the Chortis block is pinned against North America, even with low trench-normal forces, making the triple junction between the Cocos, North American, and Caribbean plates a zone of diffuse deformation. The extension in the western part of the Chortis block, from Guatemala to the Honduras depression, is explained by the geometry of the North American-Caribbean plate boundary and the direction of motion of the Caribbean plate with respect to North America. The direction of extension in the Chortis block is always E-W regardless of the magnitude of the applied forces, and the main part of the deformation is absorbed between the Ipala graben and the Honduras depression, both features being consistent with our models.},

abstract = {The relative contribution of topographic (e.g., ridge push, continental margins, and elevated continental crust) and plate boundary (e.g., subduction and collisional) forces to the intraplate stress field in the Indo-Australian plate (IAP) is evaluated through a finite element analysis. Two important aspects of the IAP intraplate stress field are highlighted in the present study: (1) if substantial focusing of the ridge push torque occurs along the collisional boundaries (i.e., Himalaya, New Guinea, and New Zealand), many of the first-order features of the observed stress field can be explained without appealing to either subduction or basal drag forces; and (2) it is possible to fit the observed SHmax(maximum horizontal stress orientation) and stress regime information with a set of boundary conditions that results in low tectonic stress magnitudes (e.g., tens of megapascals, averaged over the thickness of the lithosphere) throughout the plate. This study therefore presents a plausible alternative to previous studies of the IAP intraplate stress field, which predicted very large tectonic stress magnitudes (hundreds of megapascals) in some parts of the plate. In addition, topographic forces due to continental margins and elevated continental material were found to play an important role in the predicted stress fields of continental India and Australia, and the inclusion of these forces in the modeling produced a significant improvement in the fit of the predicted intraplate stresses to the available observed stress information in these continental regions. A central focus of this study is the relative importance of the boundary conditions used to represent forces acting along the northern plate margin. We note that a wide range of boundary conditions can be configured to match the large portion of the observed intraplate stress field, and this nonuniqueness continues to make modeling the IAP stress field problematic. While our study is an important step forward in understanding the sources of the IAP intraplate stress field, a more complete understanding awaits a better understanding of the relative magnitude of the boundary forces acting along the northern plate margin.},

abstract = {[1] The bending strength of subducting lithosphere plays a critical role in the Earth's plate tectonics and mantle convection, modulating the amount of slab pull transmitted to the surface and setting the boundary conditions under which plates move and deform. However, it is the subject of a lively debate how much of the potential energy of the downgoing plate is consumed in bending the plate and how the lithospheric strength is defined during this process. We model the subduction of a viscoelastic lithosphere, driven solely by the downgoing plate's buoyancy, freely sinking in a passive mantle, represented by drag forces. To investigate the dynamics of bending, (1) we vary the density and the viscosity profile within the plate from isoviscous, where strength is distributed, to strongly layered, where strength is concentrated in a thin core, and (2) we map the stress, strain, and dissipation along the downgoing plate. The effective plate strength during bending is not a simple function of average plate viscosity but is affected by rheological layering and plate thinning. Earth-like layered plates allow for the transmission of large fractions of slab pull (̃75-80{\%}) through the bend and yield a net slab pull of F netSP = 1 to 6 × 1012 N m-1, which varies with the buoyancy of plates. In all models, only a minor portion of the energy is dissipated in the bending. Surprisingly, bending dissipation hardly varies with lithospheric viscosity because in our dynamic system, the plates minimize overall dissipation rate by adjusting their bending curvature. As a result, bending dissipation, $\Phi$B, is mainly controlled by the bending moment work rate exerted by slab pull. We propose a new analytical formulation that includes a viscosity-dependent bending radius, which allows for assessment of the relative bending dissipation in the Earth's subduction zones using parameters from a recent global compilation. This yields estimates of $\Phi$ B /$\Phi$ TOT {\textless} 20{\%}. These results suggest that plates on Earth weakly resist bending, yet are able to propagate a large amount of slab pull. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Cosmetic products are generally formulated as emulsions, ointments, solutions or powders containing active ingredients. According to EU legislation, a cosmetic product is "any substance or preparation intended to be placed in contact with the various external parts of the human body with a view exclusively or mainly to cleaning, perfuming them, changing their appearance, and/or correcting body odors and/or protecting them or keeping them in good conditions". However, science advancement in both active carriers and ingredients has streamlined the process through which many cosmetic products by their delivery systems can induce modifications on the skin physiology. This is the reason why Reed and Kligman redefined these products as "cosmeceuticals", which refers to the combination of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Until recently, the term of cosmeceuticals has not had legal significance. The so-called cosmeceuticals, in fact, may induce modifications on the skin physiology, modifying, for example, transepidermal water loss, keratinocytes cohesion and turnover, modulating the inflammatory cascade, and/or altering the surface microbiota by the activity of the preservatives content. For these reasons, they are claimed to have medical or drug-like benefits. Naturally, their effectiveness on minor skin disorders or mild skin abnormalities has to be shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. On the other hand, their formulations contain emulsifiers, preservatives, and other chemicals which, by their cumulative use, may provoke side effects, such as allergic and/or sensitization phenomena. Moreover, many ingredients and packaging for such products are not biodegradable. In this study, we would like to introduce an innovative category of cosmeceuticals made by biodegradable nonwoven tissues. These cosmeceutical tissues, produced through the use of natural fibers, may bind different active ingredients and therefore become effective as antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, sun-protective, whitening, or anti-aging products, depending on the ingredient(s) used. Differently from the usual cosmetics, they do not contain preservatives, emulsifiers, colors, and other chemicals. They can be applied as dried tissue on wet skin, remaining in loco for around 30 min, slowly releasing the active ingredients entrapped into the fibers. It is interesting to underline that the tissue, acting as a carrier, has its own effectiveness via chitin and lignin polymers with an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. When hydrolyzed by the human microbiota enzymes, they give rise to ingredients used as cell nourishment or energy. This paper will review part of the scientific research results, supporting this new category of biodegradable cosmetic products known as facial mask sheets.},

The basic idea is to perform all the manipulations in the principal stress space and thereby achieve very simple formulae for calculating the plastic corrector stresses, based on the constant gradient of such criteria. The return formulae are in closed form and no iteration is required. The method accounts for three types of stress return: return to a single yield plane, to a discontinuity line at the intersection of two yield planes and to a discontinuity point at the intersection between three or more yield planes. The infinitesimal and the consistent elastoplastic constitutive matrix are calculated for each type of stress return, as are the conditions to ascertain which type of return is required. The method is exemplified with the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Different petrological models of the continental and oceanic lithosphere, combined with different geotherms and thicknesses, are used to generate models covering a variety of geodynamic situations. Results show that the depth-dependence of lithospheric rheology varies with the tectonic province, and that in many instances the continental lithosphere has one (at the bottom of the crust) or two (the previous one plus another at mid-crustal levels) soft ductile layers sandwiched between brittle layers. The depth distribution of geophysical parameters (seismicity, seismic wave velocity, and electrical conductivity) matches the theological predictions well. The lithospheric rheological profiles are used to analyze observed variations in the structural style of deformed continental margin and oceanic terranes in the southeastern Canadian Cordillera. The large-scale characteristics of the system show a satisfactory agreement with the inferred rheological structure. Sub-horizontal decollements should be the rule rather than the exception where the lithospheric rheology is strongly stratified. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

It was found that the nose shape of the projectile severely affected both the energy absorption and the failure mode of the target structure during penetration. This part of the paper describes numerical simulations of the problem investigated experimentally. A constitutive model of viscoplasticity and ductile damage for projectile impact has earlier been developed and implemented in the explicit finite element code LS-DYNA. Numerical simulations involving this model have been carried out, and the results are compared with the experimental data. However, numerical problems associated with the element mesh were detected, and adaptive meshing was found necessary in order to obtain reliable results for conical projectiles. From the numerical simulations it is found that the LS-DYNA code is able to describe the different failure modes without any predefined defects in the element mesh if special care is taken, and good agreement is in general obtained between the numerical simulations and experimental results. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The study of several swarm earthquake regions led us to the assumption that swarm quakes mostly occur in combination with fluid migration and often in the neighbourhood of volcanoes. Observations of the strong carbon dioxide flux and investigations of Weinlich et al. (1999) about recent volcanism in the Vogtland/ Western Bohemia are the linking part to global observations of swarm earthquakes. This idea and the theoretical modelling of Yamashita (1999) were the starting point to develop a model using the finite-element- method with the software package ABAQUS concerning stress field, porepressure, temperature and deformation in the Vogtland swarm quake area. The model is intended to reveal the interaction between fluid migration, temperature changes and deformation in this area. Its horizontal dimensions are 55 km ×60 km and 30 km in depth. The main geological units include the Marianske Lazne Fault Zone and the Eger Rift. We focus on that part of the Vogtland/Western Bohemia region where these two fault zones cross. The model takes into consideration the stress field, Mohr-Coulombfailu re, thermal stresses as well as creep and poro-elastoplastic rheologies. The results show that the rate of deformation and the stress accumulation caused only by the regional stress field is not high enough to generate the swarm earthquakes. But periodic change of pore pressure (which includes fluid migration) in combination with temperature changes has a severe influence on the rate of deformation and is in the dimension to cause swarm quakes. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {The Krishna-Godavari basin is a rifted passive margin basin that developed orthogonally to the NW-SE trending Pranhita-Godavari graben along the central Eastern Continental Margin of India in response to the continental rifting process and the subsequent seafloor spreading between India and eastern Antarctica during the early Cretaceous period. The 3-D gravity interpretation of both the onshore and offshore sections of the basin integrated with detailed seismic reflection and refraction data provided significant new information about the crustal architecture and the early breakup history of the basin. The gravity-derived crustal models indicate that the crust at the eastern Indian shield margin is 39-41 km thick and thins to as much as 20-23 km at the Ocean Continent Transition (OCT) in the offshore. There is a significant variation in the nature of crust and the configuration along the margin between the three crustal domains encompassing the basin: the Cuddapah basin, Pranhita-Godavari Graben, and the Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt that indicates the lateral segmentation of the margin. A zone of high density (3.0 g/cm 3) crustal material at the OCT separates the pure continental and oceanic crusts on either side. The Moho is shallowest along this zone and brought the upper mantle notably close to the surface, which indicates that it could be comprised of Proto-Oceanic Crustal rocks. Furthermore, the present study highlights a major basement structural high in the deep offshore area of the margin. The geophysical signatures over this structure suggest that it is a crustal scale feature that is characterized by intrusive volcanic rocks, comprised of low density crust, and lies close to the OCT towards offshore. Based on the inferred tectonic reconstruction, we believe that this structural high could be a continental fragment that was left behind during the process of breakup between India and the Elan Bank. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper presents a method for predicting S-wave velocity from the P-wave velocity on the basis of the moduli of dry rock. Elastic velocities of water-saturated sediments at low frequencies can be predicted from the moduli of dry rock by using Gassmann's equation; hence, if the moduli of dry rock can be estimated from P-wave velocities, then S-wave velocities easily can be predicted from the moduli. Dry rock bulk modulus can be related to the shear modulus through a compaction constant. The numerical results indicate that the predicted S-wave velocities for consolidated and unconsolidated sediments agree well with measured velocities if differential pressure is greater than approximately 5 MPa . An advantage of this method is that there are no adjustable parameters to be chosen, such as the pore-aspect ratios required in some other methods. The predicted S-wa...},

abstract = {Obduction emplaces regional-scale fragments of oceanic lithosphere (ophiolites) over continental lithosphere margins of much lower density. For this reason, the mechanisms responsible for obduction remain enigmatic in the framework of plate tectonics. We present two-dimensional (2D) thermo-mechanical models of obduction and investigate the possible dynamics and physical controls of this process. Model geometry and boundary conditions are based on available geological and geochronological data and numerical modeling results are validated against petrological and structural observations of the Oman (Semail) Ophiolite. Our model reproduces the stages of oceanic subduction initiation away from the Arabian margin, the emplacement of the Oman Ophiolite on top of it, and the domal exhumation of the metamorphosed margin through the ophiolitic nappe. A systematic study indicates that 350-400 km of bulk shortening provides the best fit for both maximum pressure-temperature conditions of the metamorphosed margin (1.5-2.5 GPa/450-600 °C) and the dimension of the ophiolitic nappe ({\~{}}170 km width). Our results confirm that a thermal anomaly located close to the Arabian margin ({\~{}}100 km) is needed to initiate obduction. We further suggest that a strong continental basement rheology is a prerequisite for ophiolite emplacement.},

abstract = {A number of possible mechanisms have recently been proposed for driving the motions of the lithospheric plates, such as pushing from mid-ocean ridges, pulling by downgoing slabs, suction toward trenches, and coupling of the plates to flow in the mantle. We advance a new observational method of testing these theories of the driving mechanism. Our basic approach is to solve the inverse problem of determining the relative strength of the plausible driving forces, given the observed motions and geometries of the lithospheric plates. Since the inertia of the plates is negligible, each plate must be in dynamic equilibrium, so that the sum of the torques acting on a plate must be zero. Thus, our problem is to determine the relative sizes of the forces that minimize the components of net torque on each plate. The results indicate that the forces acting on the downgoing slab control the velocity of the oceanic plates and are an order of magnitude stronger than any other force. Namely, all the oceanic plates attached to substantial amounts of downgoing slabs move with a ‘terminal velocity' at which the gravitational body force pulling the slabs downward is nearly balanced with the resistance acting on the slab; regardless of the other features of the trailing horizontal part of the plates. The drag on the bottom of the plates which resist motion is stronger under the continents than under the oceans.},

abstract = {Many types of rock masses behave in a strain-softening way in geotechnical engineering. Numerical methods have to be used to study these kinds of media. But a limit to the rate of softening of the strain-softening material exists within the framework of the classical theory of plasticity. Considering the salient characteristic that the strength parameters decrease during the process of strain-softening, this paper develops a procedure for modeling strain-softening behavior based on the methodology for analyzing brittle-plastic rock mass. In the proposed procedure, strain-softening process is simplified as a series of stress drops and plastic flow. Therefore, solving a strain-softening problem becomes finding a series of brittle-plastic solutions. The proposed procedure is implemented in a finite element code based on the classical theory of plasticity in which Mohr-Coulomb (M-C) criterion is employed. Numerical examples are examined and the results validate the proposed implementation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Manea2006,
abstract = {We present a model of the subducting Cocos slab beneath Central Mexico, that provides an explanation for stresses causing the occurrence of the majority of the intraslab earthquakes which are concentrated in a long flat segment. Based on the recently developed thermal models for the Central Mexico subduction zone, the thermal stresses due to non-uniform temperature contrast in the subducting slab are calculated using a finite element approach. The slab is considered purely elastic but due to high temperature at its bottom the behavior is considered as ductile creep. The calculation results show a ∼ 20 km slab core characterized by a tensional state of stress with stresses up to 70 MPa. On the other hand, the top of the slab experiences high compressive thermal stresses up to 110 MPa, depending on the elastic constants used and location along the flat part of the subducting plate. These compressive stresses at the top of the slab are not consistent with the exclusive normal fault intraslab earthquakes, and two different sources of stress are proposed. The trenchward migration of the Mexican volcanic arc for the last 7 Ma indicates an increase of the slab dip through time. This observation suggests that the gravity torque might exceed the suction torque. Considering the flat slab as an embedded plate subject to an applied clockwise net torque of 0.5 × 1016-1.5 × 1016 N m, the upper half would exhibit tensional stresses of 40-110 MPa that can actually balance the compressive thermally induced stresses. An alternative stress source might come from the slab pull force caused by the slab positive density anomaly. Based on our density anomaly estimations (75 ± 20 kg/m3), a 350 km slab length, dipping at 20° into the asthenosphere, induces a slab pull force of 1.7 × 1012-4.6 × 1012 N m. This force produces a tensional stress of 41-114 MPa, sufficient to balance the compressive thermal stresses at the top of the flat slab. The linear superposition of the thermally and torque or slab pull induced stresses shows tensile stresses up to 60-180 MPa inside the flat slab core. Also, our results suggest that the majority of the intraslab earthquakes inside the flat slab are situated where the resultant stresses are larger than 40-80 MPa. This study provides a reasonable explanation for the existence of exclusively normal fault intraslab earthquakes in the flat slab beneath Central Mexico, and also it shows that thermal stresses due to non-uniform reheating of subducting slabs play a considerable role in the total stress field. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Bouguer gravity anomalies characteristically vary from negative to positive values across craton-mobile belt boundaries in Precambrian shields. This transition is also documented in eastern India, where Proterozoic granulites of the Eastern Ghats Belt (EGB) form part of a mobile belt to the south of the late Archaean, amphibolite facies Rengali Province. The northern margin of the EGB with the Rengali Province is a sub-vertical Cambro-Ordovician strike-slip shear zone, on which the Talchir Gondwana sedimentary basin was deposited during late Palaeozoic extension. This extension also led to partial uplift of the lower crust below the terrane boundary. Closely coordinated geological and gravity studies were conducted through the basin, across the craton-mobile belt contact. Modeling of the Bouguer anomaly using 2-D and 3-D compact inversion schemes, along with 2-D forward modeling, indicates significant differences in the density configurations of the uppermost crusts of the EGB and the Rengali Province, as indicated by the surface geology. However, both inverse and forward models consistently predict that below {\~{}}. 7 km, density configurations across the contact are similar and have low upper crustal values, suggesting that typically cratonic crust lies below both terranes. Since it is highly unlikely that lower crust can remain unaffected during granulite facies metamorphism, it is inferred that the present sub-surface EGB crust could not have experienced the high grade event. Rather, the EGB rocks were probably overthrust onto the craton significantly after granulite metamorphism. The top of the thrust sheet may have been eroded prior to or post-dating the overthrusting, leaving the present EGB granulites stranded on low density cratonic crust below.},

abstract = {To investigate the possible physical mechanisms of recently observed aseismic slip events in the Cascadia, Japan and Mexico subduction zones, we apply a Dieterich- Ruina rate and state friction law to a three dimensional model of a shallow subduction fault. That is loaded by imposed steady plate slip rate far downdip along the thrust interface. Friction properties are temperature and hence depth- dependent, such that sliding is stable at depths below about 30 km. The system is perturbed into a significantly nonuniform slip mode along strike by introducing small along- strike variations in the constitutive parameters a and ( a - b). In addition to large heterogeneous earthquake slip at seismogenic depths, and associated postseismic transients, we found that slip events which have clearly aseismic slip rates emerge spontaneously around the downdip end of the seismogenic zone. Both transients which start well after a seismic event, and those which are triggered by other transients, are observed from the simulations. The slip velocity, depth range, and, sometimes, along- strike migration speed of simulated transients are similar to the observations from natural subduction zones. Unstable- stable transitional friction properties near the downdip end of the seismogenic zone are suggested to be an ingredient allowing such transients. Simulated transients can weaken the locking intensity of the updip seismogenic zone, while enhancing that of the transition zone. Spatial-temporal correlation of aseismic transients and nearby seismicity in the Guerrero, Mexico, area suggests that transients may signal a period of increased probability for nucleating their high- frequency counterparts, as damaging subduction thrust events.},

abstract = {S U M M A R Y Non-classical nonlinear elasticity in micro-inhomogeneous materials such as rocks and cracked or granular materials leads to a number of phenomena ranging from hysteresis and memory to a transient response of elastic properties to perturbations in dynamic or quasi-static experiments. Dynamic acousto-elastic testing (DAET) provides very detailed observations of some of these phenomena that are still not fully understood in terms of their physical origin. We suggest that the observations of non-classical nonlinear elasticity can be related to the physics of friction. We propose a conceptual model for the nonlinear elasticity based on friction of internal interfaces and the process of contact aging that leads to an increase of friction with increasing contact time. The central element of the model is the continuous interplay between (1) softening that occurs as small-scale damage due to shear motion of internal contacts and (2) stiffening (healing) as a thermally activated process of establishing connections across the contact at the current strain state. Chemical bonds, mineral fibres or capillary bridges are the most likely candidates for the physical nature of these connections. Our model qualitatively describes dynamic softening, hysteresis, slow dynamics and the shape of DAET loops including the absence of cusps and the loop orientation that leads to a stiffening at both maxima and minima of the dynamic strain.},

In this work, we overview the state-of-the-art progress on the regeneration of NaBH4 from anhydrous or hydrated NaBO2 that is a byproduct of NaBH4 hydrolysis. The anhydrous NaBO2 can be regenerated effectively by MgH2, whereas the production of MgH2 from Mg requires high temperature to overcome the sluggish hydrogenation kinetics. Compared to that of anhydrous NaBO2, using the direct hydrolysis byproduct of hydrated NaBO2 as the starting material for regeneration exhibits significant advantages, i.e., omission of the high-temperature drying process to produce anhydrous NaBO2 and the water included can react with chemicals like Mg or Mg2Si to provide hydrogen. It is worth emphasizing that NaBH4 could be regenerated by an energy efficient method and a large-scale regeneration system may become possible in the near future.},

abstract = {A constitutive model was developed to describe the nonlinear behaviour of intact rocks under static loading. The model includes the pre-peak elastic and the post-peak strain-softening behaviour, as well as dilation. The model employs the shrinking of the failure criteria by progress of plastic deformation, to consider the strain-softening behaviour of rocks. A non-associated plastic potential function based on the dilation angle is employed to formulate the plastic deformation and dilation of rocks. Triaxial laboratory test results are used to derive the model equations. The model employs the assumptions that crack propagation in rocks during post-peak deformation is a cohesion-losing process, during which the frictional angle is constant. The assumptions were verified through careful study of the laboratory test results. In the developed model, the dilation angle is associated with the confining stress, friction angle of rocks and uniaxial compressive strength of rocks. Rocks have peak dilation angle at the point of peak strength and after that, it decreases with progress of plastic deformation, and is close to zero when rocks reach residual strength. The developed model is implemented in a finite difference code. The numerical results are compared with the test results, which show that the model captures the post-peak behaviour of rocks well. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {High-resolution shipboard geophysical investigations along the Indian Ocean ridge system are sparse especially over the Carlsberg and Central Indian ridges. In the present study, the shipboard gravity and multibeam bathymetry data acquired over a 750 km long section of the Central Indian Ridge between 3{\textordmasculine}S and 11{\textordmasculine}S have been analysed to understand the crustal structure and the ridge segmentation pattern. The mantle Bouguer anomalies (MBA) and the residual mantle Bouguer anomalies (RMBA) computed in the study area have shown significant variations along the ridge segments that are separated by transform and non-transform discontinuities. The MBA lows observed over the linear ridge segments bounded by well-defined transform faults are attributed to the thickening of the crust at the middle portions of the ridge segments. The estimates of crustal thickness from the RMBA shows an average of 5.2 km thick crust in the axial part of the ridge segments. The MBA and relative RMBA highs along the two nontransform discontinuities suggests a thinner crust of up to 4.0 km. The most significant MBA and RMBA highs were observed over the Vema transform fault suggesting thin crust of 4 km in the deepest part of the transform fault where bathymetry is more than 6000 m. The identified megamullion structures have relative MBA highs suggesting thinner crust. Besides MBA lows along the ridge axis, significant off-axis MBA lows have been noticed, suggesting off-axis mantle upwelling zones indicative of thickening of the crust. The rift valley morphology varies from the typical V-shaped valley to the shallow valley floor with undulations on the inner valley floor. Segments with shallow rift valley floor have depicted well-defined circular MBA lows with persistent RMBA low, suggesting modulation of the valley floor morphology due to the variations in crustal thickness and the mantle temperature. These are supported by thicker crust and weaker lithospheric mantle.},

abstract = {The Precambrian Dharwar Craton of Peninsular India comprises three distinct crustal domains, namely the Western Dharwar Craton (WDC), the Eastern Dharwar Craton (EDC) and the Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt (EGMB). The domain boundaries are demarcated by bipolar (positive and negative) gravity anomalies, measured along a 600 km long Udipi-Kavali seismic line. The two and half dimensional modelling of the gravity anomalies, well constrained by available seismic depth-sections, identified the two contact zones. One occurs between the WDC (relatively low density) and the EDC (intermediate density), to the east of the Chitradurga Schist Belt and the second occurs between the EDC and the EGMB (high density), to the east of Cuddapah Basin as west verging thrust faults. The three-layer crustal structure is up to 41 km thick beneath the WDC, thinning to 37 km beneath the west coast. Under the EDC, the depth of the Moho varies from 38 km towards the west to 40 km beneath the Cuddapah Basin, and decreases to a depth of 35 km beneath the EGMB. A high-density steeply inclined ridge-like body is modelled between 5 and 20 km depth beneath the Closepet Granite, and a similar body is modelled under the EGMB. It is suggested that the three domains of the Dharwar Craton were brought and welded together at the suture zones in the period from Late Archaean to Late Proterozoic through collisional tectonics. The apparent offsets in the Moho depth may be the imprint of the relative domain movement that probably was initiated by the convergent plate motion. The steeply inclined ridge-like high-density bodies are interpreted as stacked lower crustal blocks from the convergent tectonic setting. The Cuddapah Basin, with a 10 km thick shelf-marine sedimentary sequence, is interpreted as a peripheral foreland basin abutting the EGMB. A lopolith of likely mafic composition is modelled at 10 km depth, and is interpreted as a product of juvenile magmatism beneath the EDC. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The rheological properties of rocks are closely related to long-term stability and safety in geotechnical engineering. After analysing the shear rheological test curve of granite samples taken from the mining slope in the Bangpu Mining Area of Tibet, a superlinear viscoplastic model (named the SLVP model) is developed based on the constitutive Nishihara model. It is found that the SLVP model can satisfactorily describe the three shear rheological stages of the granite and fit the rock properties in the accelerated rheological stage. For the 1–1 profile of the slope excavated in the Bangpu Mining Area of Tibet, stabilities of the excavated slope are calculated and analysed. The results show that, at the middle-upper step and the toe of the excavated slope, the displacement and the plastic zone are considerably different for cases with and without rheological deformation. The maximum displacement considering rheological deformation is 14.1 times greater than that without rheological deformation. The slope is not stable in general and serious failure at the excavated slope is possible. Early warning measures should be taken and the middle-upper step and the toe areas of the excavated slope should be strengthened, and the early warning and monitoring measures should be taken in relevant areas.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers. A modified bounding surface plastic sand model for geotechnical earthquake engineering application is developed to capture essential soil dynamic characteristics. The modification is upon the simple critical state compatible, bounding surface theory based, and fabric-dilatancy related sand plasticity model (DM04 model) introduced by Dafalias and Manzari (2004). By revising some formula without destroying the conciseness of the original DM04 model, the modifications improve the matches between the simulated results and various laboratory or field observations with various initial and loading conditions. The modified model switches all void-ratio related formula, including the elastic modulus, plastic hardening modulus, and critical state, to be relative density related. The modified model embraces an easier calibration procedure in terms of in situ data, such as normalized blow counts instead of experimental data in the laboratory. The modified model retains the general 3D formulation, considering Lode angle effect, and thus can be used for general 3D boundary value problems. The modified model preserves the feature that one set of model constants is used to simulate different responses with different initial relative densities and initial stress states.},

abstract = {The mechanical behavior of the cortical bone in nanoindentation is a complicated mechanical problem. The finite element analysis has commonly been assumed to be the most appropriate approach to this issue. One significant problem in nanoindentation modeling of the elastic–plastic materials is pile-up deformation, which is not observed in cortical bone nanoindentation testing. This phenomenon depends on the work-hardening of materials; it doesn't occur for work-hardening materials, which suggests that the cortical bone could be considered as a work-hardening material. Furthermore, in a recent study [59], a plastic hardening until failure was observed on the micro-scale of a dry ovine osteonal bone samples subjected to micropillar compression. The purpose of the current study was to apply an isotropic hardening model in the finite element simulations of the nanoindentation of the cortical bone to predict its mechanical behavior. The Johnson–Cook (JC) model was chosen as the constitutive model. The finite element modeling in combination with numerical optimization was used to identify the unknown material constants and then the finite element solutions were compared to the experimental results. A good agreement of the numerical curves with the target loading curves was found and no pile-up was predicted. A Design Of Experiments (DOE) approach was performed to evaluate the linear effects of the material constants on the mechanical response of the material. The strain hardening modulus and the strain hardening exponent were the most influential parameters. While a positive effect was noticed with the Young's modulus, the initial yield stress and the strain hardening modulus, an opposite effect was found with the Poisson's ratio and the strain hardening exponent. Finally, the JC model showed a good capability to describe the elastoplastic behavior of the cortical bone.},

abstract = {We will discuss the following question: is the present day normal gravity field calculation suitable from the aspect of the applied geophysics/gravimetry? Today, the normal field or theoretical gravity is on a regular basis strictly related to a model of rotational biaxial ellipsoid with one important property, namely the constant potential on its surface. This condition, however, would require a specific density distribution within the model. Another issue is the treating the Earth atmosphere and topography. These masses are simply moved into the interior of such ellipsoid and "dissolved" there. In short, this approach does not fit the geophysical reality very well. Instead, in our contribution, we attempt to calculate the normal field as the gravity effect of a layered rotational ellipsoid, namely the gravitational effect of a suitable set of homeoid shells bounded by two similar ellipsoids having a constant ratio of axes, plus the centrifugal component. We believe that this approach will fit the structure and density distribution within the Earth much better. We analyze and present the primary differences between the two approaches, and we also discuss the relation of the normal field to the free-air correction.},

abstract = {Obduction emplaces regional-scale fragments of oceanic lithosphere (ophiolites) over continental lithosphere margins of much lower density. For this reason, the mechanisms responsible for obduction remain enigmatic in the framework of plate tectonics. We present two-dimensional (2D) thermo-mechanical models of obduction and investigate the possible dynamics and physical controls of this process. Model geometry and boundary conditions are based on available geological and geochronological data and numerical modeling results are validated against petrological and structural observations of the Oman (Semail) Ophiolite. Our model reproduces the stages of oceanic subduction initiation away from the Arabian margin, the emplacement of the Oman Ophiolite on top of it, and the domal exhumation of the metamorphosed margin through the ophiolitic nappe. A systematic study indicates that 350-400 km of bulk shortening provides the best fit for both maximum pressure-temperature conditions of the metamorphosed margin (1.5-2.5 GPa/450-600 °C) and the dimension of the ophiolitic nappe ({\~{}}170 km width). Our results confirm that a thermal anomaly located close to the Arabian margin ({\~{}}100 km) is needed to initiate obduction. We further suggest that a strong continental basement rheology is a prerequisite for ophiolite emplacement.},

Events along approx 1800 km of the Himalayan arc with accurately determined depths obtained from identification of surface-reflected phases define a simple, planar zone from about 10 km and 20 km depth, with an apparent dip of about 15o. Except for one, all available focal mechanisms of events within this zone indicate shallow (approx = or {\textless}30o), N dipping thrusts. This shallow, N dipping zone apparently defines a part of the detachment that separates the underthrusting Indian plate from the Lesser Himalayan crustal block. Results suggest that the Indian continental plate is underthrusting the Himalayan crustal blocks in a relatively coherent and simple geometry not much different from that observed along oceanic subduction zones. A possible genetic relationship between transverse structural features in the underthrusting Indian plate (the Kishangang basement fault) and the upper Himalayan blocks and Tibet is also suggested.-from Authors},

abstract = {A new plastic-damage constitutive model for cyclic loading of concrete has been developed for the earthquake analysis of concrete dams. The rate-independent model consistently includes the effects of strain softening, represented by separate damage variables for tension and compression.A simple scalar degradation model simulates the effects of damage on the elastic stiffness and the recovery of stiffness after cracks close. To simulate large crack opening displacements, the evolution of inelastic strain is stopped beyond a critical value for the tensile damage variable. Subsequent deformation can be recovered upon crack closing. The rate-independent plastic-damage model forms the backbone model for a rate-dependent viscoplastic extension. The rate-dependent regularization is necessary to obtain a unique and mesh objective numerical solution. Damping is represented as a linear viscoelastic behaviour proportional to the elastic stiffness including the degradation damage. The plastic-damage constitutive model is used to evaluate the response of Koyna dam in the 1967 Koyna earthquake. The analysis shows two localized cracks forming and then joining at the change in geometry of the upper part of the dam. The upper portion of the dam vibrates essentially as rigid-body rocking motion after the upper cracks form, but the dam remains stable. The vertical component of ground motion influences the post-cracking response.},

Early releases of the World Stress Map Project demonstrated the existence of first-order (plate-scale) stress fields controlled by plate boundary forces and second-order (regional) stress fields controlled by major intraplate stress sources such as mountain belts and zones of widespread glacial rebound. The 2005 release of the World Stress Map Project database provides, for some areas, high data density that enables us to investigate third-order (local) stress field variations, and the forces controlling them such as active faults, local inclusions, detachment horizons, and density contrasts. These forces act as major controls on the stress field orientations when the magnitudes of the horizontal stresses are close to isotropic. We present and discuss examples for Venezuela, Australia, Romania, Brunei, western Europe, and southern Italy where a substantial increase of data records demonstrates some of the addition factors controlling regional and local stress patterns.

When modeling geologic materials subjected to stresses ranging from one to several hundred megapascals, the cap model has several desirable features. Of primary importance is its ability to model volumetric hysteresis through the use of a strain-hardening yield surface or cap. In this chapter, the essential features of the cap model are reviewed, and the steps required to implement the cap model into the finite element code JAM are summarized. After a brief evaluation of the loading function and flow rule, the incremental elastic-plastic stress-strain relations are outlined. In addition, the cap model implemented into JAM is described, and the equations are developed for the elastic-plastic constitutive matrix and the plastic hardening modulus. Finally, the numerical implementation of the cap model itself is described. The reader should note that an engineering mechanics sign convention is used in which compression is negative.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The piled raft system is modeled using three-dimensional (3D) finite element analysis. At first, the 3D numerical model is validated with past numerical studies. This is followed by a detailed parametric study on the effect of different influential parameters, such as flexibility of raft, pile spacing to diameter ratios, and asymmetry in pile length on dynamic characteristics and seismic response of the piled raft foundation system considering dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI). It is observed that the fundamental period of the structure gets significantly lengthened with increasing raft flexibility whereas pile head shear considerably reduced. Further, non-identical pile lengths attributing asymmetric group configuration results in a significant change in the fundamental period of the structure and pile head shear.},

abstract = {Landslide hazards are a major natural disaster that affects most of the hilly regions around the world. In India, significant damages due to earthquake induced landslides have been reported in the Himalayan region and also in the Western Ghat region. Thus there is a requirement of a quantitative macro-level landslide hazard assessment within the Indian subcontinent in order to identify the regions with high hazard. In the present study, the seismic landslide hazard for the entire state of Karnataka, India was assessed using topographic slope map, derived from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. The available ASTER DEM data, resampled to 50 m resolution, was used for deriving the slope map of the entire state. Considering linear source model, deterministic seismic hazard analysis was carried out to estimate peak horizontal acceleration (PHA) at bedrock, for each of the grid points having terrain angle 10° and above. The surface level PHA was estimated using nonlinear site amplification technique, considering B-type NEHRP site class. Based on the surface level PHA and slope angle, the seismic landslide hazard for each grid point was estimated in terms of the static factor of safety required to resist landslide, using Newmark's analysis. The analysis was carried out at the district level and the landslide hazard map for all the districts in the Karnataka state was developed first. These were then merged together to obtain a quantitative seismic landslide hazard map of the entire state of Karnataka. Spatial variations in the landslide hazard for all districts as well as for the entire state Karnataka is presented in this paper. The present study shows that the Western Ghat region of the Karnataka state is found to have high landslide hazard where the static factor of safety required to resist landslide is very high. {\textcopyright} 2013 Indian Society of Remote Sensing.},

abstract = {The Cauvery–Palar basin is a major peri-cratonic rift basin located along the Eastern Continental Margin of India (ECMI) that had formed during the rift-drift events associated with the breakup of eastern Gondwanaland (mainly India–Sri Lanka–East Antarctica). In the present study, we carry out an integrated analysis of the potential field data across the basin to understand the crustal structure and the associated rift tectonics. The composite-magnetic anomaly map of the basin clearly shows the onshore-tooffshore structural continuity, and presence of several high-low trends related to either intrusive rocks or the faults. The Curie depth estimated from the spectral analysis of offshore magnetic anomaly data gave rise to 23 km in the offshore Cauvery–Palar basin. The 2D gravity and magnetic crustal models indicate several crustal blocks separated by major structures or faults, and the rift-related volcanic intrusive rocks that characterize the basin. The crustal models further reveal that the crust below southeast Indian shield margin is ∼36 km thick and thins down to as much as 13–16 km in the Ocean Continent Transition (OCT) region and increases to around 19–21 km towards deep oceanic areas of the basin. The faulted Moho geometry with maximum stretching in the Cauvery basin indicates shearing or low angle rifting at the time of breakup between India–Sri Lanka and the East Antarctica. However, the additional stretching observed in the Cauvery basin region could be ascribed to the subsequent rifting of Sri Lanka from India. The abnormal thinning of crust at the OCT is interpreted as the probable zone of emplaced Proto-Oceanic Crust (POC) rocks during the breakup. The derived crustal structure along with other geophysical data further reiterates sheared nature of the southern part of the ECMI.},

abstract = {A brief review of experimental and theoretical results about the effect of topography on seismic motion shows that they are consistent only on a qualitative basis. Amplification at mountain tops for wavelengths comparable with mountain widths is predicted and observed, but the numerical simulations often underestimate the actual observed effects. We propose that this disagreement is because current models are not complex enough. We therefore computed the response to incident SH waves of a set of different complex configurations that include two-dimensional surface topography, with or without periodic ridges and subsurface layering. The results show that: (1) the topographic effect in itself is difficult to isolate from other effects, like surface layering, and therefore the amplification on top of geomorphologically complex sites cannot be predicted by a priori estimations based solely on topography; and (2) the high crest/base amplification ratio observed in the field cannot, usually, be matched even with complex two-dimensional structures with incident plane SH waves, which suggests that more complex models are needed to incorporate more complex wave fields (e. g. , SV, surface) and three-dimensional geologic configurations.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} The properties of the subduction interplate domain are likely to affect not only the seismogenic potential of the subduction area but also the overall subduction process, as it influences its viability. Numerical simulations are performed to model the long-term equilibrium state of the subduction interplate when the diving lithosphere interacts with both the overriding plate and the surrounding convective mantle. The thermomechanical model combines a non-Newtonian viscous rheology and a pseudo-brittle rheology. Rock strength here depends on depth, temperature and stress, for both oceanic crust and mantle rocks. I study the evolution through time of, on one hand, the brittle-ductile transition (BDT) depth, {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BDT{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, and, on the other hand, of the kinematic decoupling depth, {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}dec{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, simulated along the subduction interplate. The results show that both a high friction and a low ductile strength at the asthenospheric wedge tip shallow {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BDT{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. The influence of the weak material activation energy is of second order but not negligible. {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BDT{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} becomes dependent on the ductile strength increase with depth (activation volume) if the BDT occurs at the interplate decoupling depth. Regarding the interplate decoupling depth, it is shallowed (1) significantly if mantle viscosity at asthenospheric wedge tip is low, (2) if the difference in mantle and interplate activation energy is weak, and (3) if the activation volume is increased. Very low friction coefficients and/or low asthenospheric viscosities promote {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}BDT{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}dec{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. I then present how the subducting lithosphere age affects the brittle-ductile transition depth and the kinematic decoupling depth in this model. Simulations show that a rheological model in which the respective activation energies of mantle and interplate material are too close hinders the mechanical decoupling at the down-dip extent of the interplate, and eventually jams the subduction process during incipient subduction of a young (20-Myr-old) and soft lithosphere under a thick upper plate. Finally, both the BDT depth and the decoupling depth are a function of the subducting plate age, but are not influenced in the same fashion: cool and old subducting plates deepen the BDT but shallow the interplate decoupling depth. Even if BDT and kinematic decoupling are intrinsically related to different mechanisms of deformation, this work shows that they are able to interact closely. Comparison between modelling results and observations suggests a minimum friction coefficient of 0.045 for the interplate plane, even 0.069 in some cases, to model realistic BDT depths. The modelled {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}dec{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} is a bit deeper than suggested by geophysical observations. Eventually, the better way to improve the adjustment to observations may rely on a moderate to strong asthenosphere viscosity reduction in the metasomatised mantle wedge.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

For evaluating their liquefaction potential during an earthquake, no guidelines are available based on their density, void ratio, plasticity index, standard penetration values, or any other simple soil property. Their liquefaction behavior is not properly understood at present and is often confused with that of sand-silt mixtures. Pore water pressures and liquefaction in silt and silt-clay mixtures are discussed, and the influences of plasticity index on their cyclic strength are reviewed critically. It is concluded that considerable additional work is needed to fully understand the liquefaction behavior of these soils.},

@article{Kostov2014,
abstract = {The current paper presents key elements of the comprehensive analyses of the effects due to a large aircraft collision with the reactor building of Belene NPP in Bulgaria. The reactor building is a VVER A92; it belongs to the third+ generation and includes structural measures for protection against an aircraft impact as standard design. The A92 reactor building implements a double shell concept and is composed of thick RC external walls and an external shell which surrounds an internal pre-stressed containment and the internal walls of the auxiliary building. The malevolent large aircraft impact is considered as a beyond design base accident (Design Extended Conditions, DEC). The main issues under consideration are the structural integrity, the equipment safety due to the induced vibrations, and the fire safety of the entire installation. Many impact scenarios are analyzed varying both impact locations and loading intensity. A large number of non-linear dynamic analyses are used for assessment of the structural response and capacity, including different type of structural models, different finite element codes, and different material laws. The corresponding impact loadings are represented by load time functions calculated according to three different approaches, i.e. loading determined by Riera's method (Riera, 1968), load time function calculated by finite element analysis (Henkel and Klein, 2007), and coupled dynamic analysis with dynamic interaction between target and projectile. Based on the numerical results and engineering assessments the capacity of the A92 reactor building to resist a malevolent impact of a large aircraft is evaluated. Significant efforts are spent on safety assessment of equipment by using an evaluation procedure based on damage indicating parameters. As a result of these analyses several design modifications of structure elements are performed. There are changes of the layout of reinforcement, special arrangements and spatial reinforcement to increase shear resistance, as well as increase of the flexure reinforcement in most of the external protective structures. Significant requirements are formulated regarding the equipment stability; some requirements for the passive safety systems are adjusted and spatial arrangement of equipment are improved. All the investigated scenarios show that there are sufficient margins to prevent a severe accident. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the seismic response analysis of an internal shearwall of a typical Indian reactor resting on a medium dense sandy silty soil, incorporating the nonlinear behavior of the soil-foundation interface. The modeling is done in an open-source finite element framework, OpenSees, where the soil-structure interaction (SSI) is modeled using a Beam-on-Nonlinear- Winkler-Foundation (BNWF) approach. Static pushover analysis and cyclic analysis are performed followed by an incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) with 30 recorded ground motions. For performing IDA, the spectral acceleration of each motion corresponding to the fundamental period, Sa(T1)is incremented from 0.1 g to 1.0 g with an increment step of 0.1 g. It is observed from the cyclic analysis that the equivalent viscous damping of the system increases upto twice upon incorporation of inelastic SSI. The IDA results demonstrate that the average peak base shear, base moment and displacement ductility demand reduces as much as 62{\%}, 40{\%}, and 35{\%}, respectively, whereas the roof drift demand increases up to 25{\%} upon consideration of foundation nonlinearity for the highest intensity motion. These observations indicate the need of critical consideration of nonlinear soil-structure interaction as any deficient modeling of the same may lead to an inaccurate estimation of the seismic demands of the structure.{\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Phase field modelling for fracture has been extended from elastic solids to elasto-plastic solids. In this study, we present the implementation procedures of a staggered scheme for phase field fracture of elasto-plastic solids in commercial finite element software Abaqus using subroutines UEL and UMAT. The UMAT is written for the constitutive behaviour of elasto-plastic solids, while the UEL is written for the phase field fracture. The phase field and displacement field are solved separately using the Newton-Raphson iteration method. In each iteration, one field is computed by freezing the other field at the last loading increment. A number of benchmark examples are tested from one single element up to 3D problems. The correctness of the staggered scheme is verified analytically in terms of the stress-strain curve and the evolution of the phase field in the one single element example. In the 2D and 3D problems, the fracture behaviour of elasto-plastic solids can be reproduced in terms of reaction force curve and crack propagation, which exhibit good agreement with the experimental observations and numerical results in literature. Not only can the proposed implementation help attract more academic researchers, but also engineering practitioners to take the advantages of phase field modelling for fracture in elasto-plastic solids. The Abaqus subroutine codes can be downloaded online from Mendeley data repository linked to this work (The link is provided in Supplementary material).},

The reflectivity pattern varies considerably for different crustal units along the profile. The deep-crustal reflection data image two sets of oppositely dipping strong reflection bands, from upper- to lower-crustal levels. These are identified as the signatures of the collision corresponding to Aravalli and Delhi orogeny. The data also exhibit a clear Mono and strong lower-crustal reflections near the collision boundaries. A stack of dipping reflections from the top of the Moho to the surface is identified as a major thrust fault indicating that the Proterozoic collision and deformation were primarily thick-skinned in nature. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {GPlates is an open-source, cross-platform plate tectonic geographic information system, enabling the interactive manipulation of plate-tectonic reconstructions and the visualization of geodata through geological time. GPlates allows the building of topological plate models representing the mosaic of evolving plate boundary networks through time, useful for computing plate velocity fields as surface boundary conditions for mantle convection models and for investigating physical and chemical exchanges of material between the surface and the deep Earth along tectonic plate boundaries. The ability of GPlates to visualize subsurface 3-D scalar fields together with traditional geological surface data enables researchers to analyze their relationships through geological time in a common plate tectonic reference frame. To achieve this, a hierarchical cube map framework is used for rendering reconstructed surface raster data to support the rendering of subsurface 3-D scalar fields using graphics-hardware-accelerated ray-tracing techniques. GPlates enables the construction of plate deformation zones—regions combining extension, compression, and shearing that accommodate the relative motion between rigid blocks. Users can explore how strain rates, stretching/shortening factors, and crustal thickness evolve through space and time and interactively update the kinematics associated with deformation. Where data sets described by geometries (points, lines, or polygons) fall within deformation regions, the deformation can be applied to these geometries. Together, these tools allow users to build virtual Earth models that quantitatively describe continental assembly, fragmentation and dispersal and are interoperable with many other mapping and modeling tools, enabling applications in tectonics, geodynamics, basin evolution, orogenesis, deep Earth resource exploration, paleobiology, paleoceanography, and paleoclimate.},

abstract = {Highly flexible turbomachinery comprised of soft polymeric impellers, ex- hibit large, time-dependent deformation when subjected to fluid stresses during operation. The large deformations of the impeller blades and the close proximity of the blades to the pump casing require simulations that consider the interaction of the fluid flow and the structural deformations. This thesis explores the use of fluid–structure interaction (FSI) modeling to perform time-accurate simulations of flexible polymeric turbomachinery and also explores the use of an inverse structural analysis to account for blade deformations over an initial startup period. The pur- pose of the inverse analysis is to determine the shape of a blade that, when acted on by fluid stresses, will deform into the design shape. A partitioned FSI solver is developed, using the OpenFOAM software and an author-developed finite element (FE) structural solver, to perform FSI simula- tions of flexible turbomachinery. The flow and structural solvers are tightly coupled using fixed-point iterations to ensure fully converged structural and flow solvers for each solution time step. The solver interface supports disparate flow and structural meshes through interpolation and load mapping algorithms. A water tunnel test of a modified NACA 66 viscoelastic fin is performed at multiple angles of attack to generate validation data for the FSI solver. The validated solver is applied to an expandable impeller pump to simulate time-accurate performance changes that result from impeller elastic and viscoelastic deformation under application of the fluid stresses. An inverse FE structural solver is developed and used to compute inverted structural shapes that account for deformations due to fluid loads so that the struc- tures deform into their design shapes after elastic and viscoelastic deformations occur. The inverse solver is validated for several cases based on numerical sim- ulations. Time-accurate performance estimates of the expandable impeller pump for the inverted impeller shape demonstrate the accuracy of the inverse procedure when subjected to time-varying fluid forces. FSI simulation results for inverted modified NACA 66 fins are also presented. The deformed inverse shapes show good agreement with the intended (design) shapes, but slight discrepancies exist between the prescribed and simulated time at which these shapes are achieved. The slight discrepancies in the target times are attributed to inaccuracies in the load histories assumed during the inverse analyses.},

abstract = {Building codes consider the tension stiffening when calculating the crack width of the flexural members. A simple analytical procedure is proposed for the determination of forces, stresses and strains acting on a reinforced concrete section subjected to flexure considering the concrete contribution in tension up to tensile concrete strain corresponding to the cracking strength of concrete. This analytical method gives the minimum value (lower bound) of tension stiffening. Also, a commercial Finite Element Program (ABAQUS 2007) was used to perform non-linear analysis in order to evaluate the total contribution of the tensioned concrete in carrying loads which may be considered as the upper bound of tension stiffening. In addition, a comparison is carried out among the different codes using four reinforced concrete rectangular models to compare and evaluate the tension stiffening with proposed analytical lower bound tension stiffening and upper bound as obtained by ABAQUS. The models include different percentages of flexural steel ratio. The comparison revealed that the codes' equations always consider tension stiffening lying between lower and upper bound of tension stiffening proposed in this study. Also, the study showed that the tension stiffening decreases with the increase of the percentage of the flexural reinforcement ratio.{\textcopyright} 2013 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.

abstract = {Shear wave velocity structure of the NW Indian ocean is analysed by using fundamental mode Rayleigh wave dispersion data of 67 events occurred during 1990-98 at the central Indian Ridge and Carlsberg Ridge and recorded at Hyderabad Geoscope station (HYB). These events provide a dense coverage of the NW Indian ocean and Chagos-Laccadive Ridge (CLR) in the back-azimuthal range of 192-253° with respect to HYB. The dispersion curves, corrected for continental and young ocean paths, indicate large variations in the shear wave velocity structure of the region. The group velocities along the CLR path support a typical aseismic ridge-type structure. However, the central region bounded between the Central Indian Ridge and India in the back-azimuth of 206-234° indicates a decrease in the group velocity by 0.1 km/s. Inversion of these data sets indicates presence of aseismic-ridge type lithospheric structure for CLR, a thin lithosphere and high velocity block in the depth range of 125-200 km for the central region, and a continental-type lithospheric structure for the northern-most part of the Indian ocean. It is inferred that the dynamic state of the upper mantle in this region has been significantly perturbed during the recent geological past. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Using thin elastic plate theory and neglecting horizontal applied forces, a universal deflection profile applicable to many oceanic trenches is derived. This theoretical profile is compared with bathymetric profiles from the central Aleutian, Kuril, Bonin, and Mariana trench-outer rise regions. The profiles were corrected for sediment thickness and age variation of the lithosphere. Good agreement between theory and observation is found. The distance from the first point of zero deflection seaward of the trench to the point of maximum height of the outer rise is directly related to the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere. The thickness of the elastic lithosphere is found to vary between 20 and 29 km for the trench profiles considered. The good agreement obtained shows that horizontal forces may be neglected and that the bending lithosphere behaves elastically in the cases considered. The analysis shows that only unreasonably large horizontal forces would affect the universal deflection curve. It is concluded that although the near-surface lithosphere may be subject to brittle fracture, the deeper lithosphere is capable of transmitting elastic stresses as high as 9 kbar. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

abstract = {The earthquake generation cycle consists of tectonic loading, quasi-static rupture nucleation, dynamic rupture propagation and stop, and subsequent stress redistribution and fault restrengthening. From a macroscopic point of view, the entire process of earthquake generation cycles should be consistently described by a coupled nonlinear system of a slip-response function, a fault constitutive law and a driving force. On the basis of such a general idea, we constructed a realistic 3-D simulation model for earthquake generation cycles at a transcurrent plate boundary by combining the viscoelastic slip-response function derived for a two-layered elastic-viscoelastic structure model, the slip- and time-dependent fault constitutive law that has an inherent mechanism of fault restrengthening, and the steady relative plate motion as a driving force into a single closed system. With this model we numerically simulated the earthquake generation cycles repeated in a seismogenic region on a plate interface, and examined space-time changes in shear stress, slip deficits and fault constitutive properties during one complete cycle in detail. The occurrence of unstable dynamic slip brings about decrease both in fault strength and shear stress to a constant residual level. After the arrest of dynamic slip, the breakdown strength drop $\Delta$$\sigma$pof fault is restored rapidly and the process of stress accumulation resumes in the seismogenic region. On the other hand, the restoration of the critical weakening displacement Dcproceeds gradually with time through the interseismic period. The restoration of Dccan be regarded as the macroscopic manifestation of the microscopic recovery process of fractal fault surface structure. Through numerical simulation with a multi-segmented fault model, we examined the effects of viscoelastic fault- to-fault interaction. The effect of transient viscoelastic stress transfer through the asthenosphere is significant as well as the direct effect of elastic stress transfer, and it possibly explains the time lag of the sequential occurrence of large events along a plate boundary.},

abstract = {Many very large bridges with high piers and long spans are under rapid construction in mountainous regions especially in Western China. However, the current seismic design methods in China are based on a code which only applies to bridges with span up to 150 m. To evaluate the risk of the inapplicable design method and the influence of spatially variable ground motions (SVGM) on the seismic response of very large bridges, a high-pier, long-span, continuous RC frame bridge is numerically studied. This study considers whether multiple support excitation can be simplified into specific uniform excitation cases while guaranteeing the conservative seismic demands for this bridge. Non-stationary SVGM on both bedrock and the surface of multiple soil layers are simulated including wave passage effects, coherency effects and site amplification effects. The nonlinear dynamic finite element model of the bridge is analysed for two groups of earthquake motions, namely group 1 - bedrock and group 2 - ground surface excitations. Each group contains three different excitations, i.e. i) multiple support excitation ii) the largest and iii) the smallest accelerations from the SVGM. The relative displacements, internal force responses and ultimate damage modes are obtained and compared. For this bridge the uniform ground motion input with the largest accelerations provides conservative seismic demands for most structural components when the site amplification effect is not considered (group 1). However, for the ground surface motions, where site amplification needs to be taken into account (group 2), in several cases the uniform ground motion with the largest accelerations results in lower response than that predicted when considering SVGM. The present results indicate that only when the bridges are located on ideal simple topography where site effects have little influence, the uniform excitation with the largest accelerations taken from the SVGM may be an alternative input for seismic analysis. However, for bridges on complex terrain, where site effects can significantly amplify the ground motions at the bedrock, SVGM need to be applied as input for the seismic analysis. As spatial variability of input motion is not a mandatory requirement in the Chinese bridges design code, these results suggest that the existing design code for very large bridges should be modified accordingly.},

abstract = {A preliminary step to study the geomorphological features or morphometric study of any area is analysis of its relief feature. The variation of earth surface or a part of it becomes focus of a geomorphic study of landforms. The meaning of term relief may be defined as the difference in elevation of any part of the earth's surface or relative vertical inequality of land surface. Relative relief is among the techniques, those are effectively capable of presenting three dimensional relief characteristics with the help of two-dimensional maps, without considering sea level. Relief and other geomorphic elements are also based in differences in elevation. These morphometric elements are absolute relief, relative relief, slope and dissection index, etc. who, help to classify morpho units of terrain. However, in this chapter, elements, that are directly related with relief have been discussed. These elements are known to help in analysis of any landform and also in categorizing landforms into various morphounits and their relation with geology and hydrology of the area. The morphometric elements are relative relief, absolute relief, slope, and dissection index and drainage characteristics. These elements of morphometry are valuable in dividing the landforms into various morphounits and their relation with geology of a particular area, climatic and hydrological conditions as well as classification and sub classification of landforms i.e. absolute relief, slope, relief profile etc.. So, relief analysis becomes essential for studying a given area. Relief also indicates the past geological events occurred in the particular area. In the present study, elements those directly related with relief including relative relief are discussed. The surface of study area has resulted in fragments or remnatal surfaces mainly caused by faulted action of erosion. At a glance, different organic phases of study area such as denudation process have also effected relief features. The whole processes of relief depended upon the nature of relief i.e. young, mature or old, geological condition, climatic condition, rainfall, temperature, humidity, evaporation slope aspect, etc. As far as the relief is a product of a number of factors, therefore a definite class value of relative relief is not suitable for a particular nature of relief. Relief is commonly regarded as the range in altitude (Smith, 1935). This definition is logically right and acceptable. Relief analysis of any terrain may be done with the help of morphometry.

abstract = {Considering the ever-increasing landslide incidences in Indian Himalayas, a methodology has been presented to assess the risk to buildings constructed in the landslide-prone areas. Since landslide is a dynamic phenomenon, an inter-disciplinary approach is required for the assessment of elements at risk (buildings in this case). Therefore, a novel remote sensing and GIS-based semi-quantitative technique has been developed by integrating the concepts of landslide susceptibility zonation (LSZ), physical vulnerability (PV) and the proximity (Prox) of buildings from the influence zone (i.e. LSZ and drainage channels). In order to understand the acceptability of risk, the landslide risk (LR) has been categorized into three risk classes as class I (low risk), class II (moderate risk) and class III (high risk). This study aims to develop a systematic and easy to adopt methodology for hilly terrains of India in a scenario of historical data scarcity and also in line with the codal provisions of the country as well as the geographical conditions. The developed methodology is implemented in a test site of Gopeshwar Township, Chamoli District Headquarter, Uttarakhand State of India, covering an area of 8.39 km2 situated in the upper Alaknanda valley. This study will be useful in increasing the safety aspects of the infrastructures and lives and also for strategic governance of developmental activities in the times ahead, especially in developing countries.},

abstract = {Solutions in soil constitutive modeling have been based upon Hookes law of linear elasticity for describing soil behaviour under working loading condition and Coulombs law of perfect plasticity for describing soil behaviour under collapse state because of its simplicity in applications. The combination and generalization of Hooke and Coulombs law is formulated in a plasticity framework and is known as Mohr-Coulomb model. However, it is well known that soils are not linearly elastic and perfectly platic for the entire range of loading. In fact, actual behaviour of soils is very complicated and it shows a great variety of behaviour when subjected to different conditions. Various constitutive models have been proposed by several researchers to describe various aspects of soil behaviour in details and also to apply such models in finite element modelling for geotechnical engineering applications. Recent published evolution of models used for soft soils and tunnels for the past 30 years was also presented. It must be emphasized here that no soil constitutive model available that can completely describe the complex behaviour of real soils under all conditions. This paper attempts to collaborate the efforts from various researchers and present the discussion on each models with advantages and limitations for the purpose of giving an overview comparison of various soil models for engineering applications.},

abstract = {SUMMARY The large amount of data acquired along most subduction zones underlines the importance of three dimensions in the subduction mechanism. In this work we use a fully 3-D mechanical numerical model to analyse the impact of the plate boundary geometry on the deformation of the upper plate. The model consists of two initially horizontal independent plates overlying an inviscid fluid and continuously pushed towards each other. The initial geometry of the contact zone between the two plates controls the stress regime and the strain pattern in the upper plate. The case with a linear plate boundary and orthogonal convergence is first considered and used as a reference model. With this simple model, the effects of some important parameters (i.e. the interplate friction and the lithosphere-asthenosphere density contrast) are investigated. Finally, cases with curved plate boundaries are considered, and the results are used to shed light on the importance of the dip direction of the interplate plane for the upper plate strain pattern. Unnecessary oceanward convexity causes an accumulation of the subducted material beneath the upper plate and induces an important uplift of the convex area. On the contrary, the material escapes from an oceanward concavity and provokes subsidence in the forearc zone. Such a behaviour induces preferential zones of weakeness in the overriding plate and may allow for explaining some local stress regime variations along convergent margins.},

abstract = {This paper presents a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics and Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) approach to simulate the behaviour of fluid-particle interaction for applications relevant to mining and geotechnical engineering. DEM is employed to model the granular particle system, whilst the CFD is used to simulate the fluid flow by solving the locally averaged Navier-Stokes equation. The particle-fluid interaction is considered by exchanging such interaction forces as drag force and buoyancy force between the DEM and the CFD computations. The coupled CFD-DEM tool is first benchmarked by two classic geomechanics problems where analytical solutions are available, and is then employed to investigate the characteristics of sand heap formed in water through hopper flow. The influence of fluid-particle interaction on the behaviour of granular media is well captured in all the simulated problems. It is shown in particular that a sand pile formed in water is more homogeneous in terms of void ratio, contact force and fabric anisotropy. The central pressure dip of vertical stress profile at the base of sandpile is moderately reduced, as compared to the dry case. The effects of rolling resistance and polydispersity in conjunction with the presence of water on the formation of sandpile are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Safety assessment of Indian nuclear containments has been carried out for aircraft impact. The loading time history for Boeing and Airbus categories of aircrafts is generated based on the principle of momentum transfer of crushable aircrafts. The case studies include the analysis of BWR Mark III containment as a benchmark problem and analyses of Pressurised Heavy Water Reactor containment (inner and outer containment) for impulsive loading due to aircraft impact. Initially, the load is applied on outer containment wall model and subsequently the load is transferred to inner containment after the local perforation of the outer containment wall is noticed in the transient simulation. The analysis methodology evolved in the present work would be useful for studying the behavior of double containment walls and multi barrier structural configurations for aircraft impact with higher energies. The present analysis illustrates that with the provision of double containments for Indian nuclear power plants, adequate reserve strength is available for the case of an extremely low probability event of missile impact generated due to the commercial aircrafts operated in India. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Piled-raft foundations are often used to transfer the structural load to the depth of the soil and tall structures can be constructed on medium to soft soils by utilizing a group of piles. The static effects of a group of piles are quite evident while their dynamic effects are quite unknown and therefore, not considered in the design of the superstructure. In the present research, the performance of pile-raft foundations on the seismic response of a 20-story benchmark building resting on soft clayey soil has been investigated using a 2D finite difference model, namely FLAC. The study has been carried out by analyzing the seismic response of the structure with and without pile-raft foundations, on the surface and inside an excavation. The results show that when the structure is constructed on the surface, piled-raft foundations have a significant beneficial effect on the seismic response of the superstructure, for instance a 40{\%} decrease in the base shear. In the case where the structure is located inside an excavation the use of piled-raft foundations are not noteworthy and do not have a considerable effect. The results of this study give an insight on the effects of pile-raft foundations on the seismic response of a superstructure to overcome the current shortage of information in this area and to better predict the behavior of tall structures in soft soil situations.},

abstract = {An elastic finite element approach has been used with the dual aim of determining the most appropriate reference state of stress, namely a uniaxial strain state or a lithostatic state, and refining the understanding of the Iberian intraplate stresses. A cross-section model with an average crustal rheology and a flat topography has been analysed first in order to evaluate the influence of boundary conditions and rheological properties in the reference and tectonic stress states. The uniaxial and lithostatic states are obtained by including the overburden weight and a compressive horizontal load, which equals the uniaxial and lithostatic stress respectively, and provided that Poisson's ratio equals {\~{}} 0.5 in the lithostatic state. On the other hand, a tectonic state with a $\sigma$H {\textgreater} $\sigma$V regime is reproduced by adding a horizontal constant load. Subsequently, constraints on the magnitude of the predicted Cenozoic stresses along a NW-SE cross-section in the southern border of the Spanish Central System (in the Variscan granitic basement of El Berrocal) have been estimated incorporating the topographic loading, lithological variations and the most recent far tectonic stresses. The deep geological structure has been established from gravity modelling and geological data. To simulate the active strike-slip to uniaxial extension regimes in the interior of Iberian Peninsula, a lithostatic initial state has to be considered and a tectonic load in the range of 15-20 MPa has to be applied. The gradient of maximum horizontal stress originated under these conditions is in the range of 30-35 MPa km- 1. These results are in accordance with the estimated intraplate tectonic stress, the force along the convergent plate boundary of Eurasia-Africa, the lithospheric strength of Iberia, and the direct measurements of stresses. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The globally growing demand for energy and mineral resources, the need for reliable projections of future climate processes, and the necessity for coast protection to mitigate threats and hazards of disasters require a comprehensive understanding of the genesis and structure of the marine geosphere and processes involving it. The “classical” research fields in marine geology are being currently supplemented by the development of more general concepts which strive to integrate marine geophysics, hydrography, climatology, marine biology, and ecology. The term “marine geosciences” has been broadly accepted to serve as an “umbrella” for this new complex field of research and practical solutions in the marine realm. We have reflected this development by putting together the Encyclopedia of Marine Geosciences which appears as a volume of the Encyclopedia in Earth Sciences Series. When collecting entries for the Encyclopedia of Marine Geosciences, we intended to provide the current state of knowledge in marine geosciences and to cover their theoretical, applied, and technical aspects. However, as we were working on the Encyclopedia, it became clear to us that one printed volume cannot accommodate all the disciplinary basics of marine geosciences. Therefore, the reader seeking explanation of a specific scientific term is advised to consult not only the list of entries, but also to take a look on the back-of-the-book index. The index can be used as a search engine for text paragraphs in this volume dealing with the words of interest. Because of the complex nature of marine geosciences, we do realize that some overlap with the “classical” research geosciences fields, already covered by other volumes of the Encyclopedia in Earth Sciences Series, must have occurred in the present volume. We did our best to avoid repetitions in this volume and we advise the reader to consult, whenever necessary, other Encyclopedias in the Earth Science Series volumes such as Encyclopedia of Coastal Science, Encyclopedia of Geochemistry, Encyclopedia of Paleoclimatology and Ancient Environments, or Encyclopedia of Sediments and Sedimentary Rocks. With this volume, we hope to reach out to a broad audience of users concerned with marine sciences and technology, from students and scholars in academia to engineers in the industry to decision makers in administration and politics. The editorial team of the Encyclopedia of Marine Geosciences reflects the diversity of disciplines covered: MartinMeschede took over responsibility for manuscripts related to plate tectonics, Sven Petersen dealt with those focusing on magmatism, J{\"{o}}rn Thiede was responsible for entries on deep ocean processes, and Jan Harff edited the entries related to ocean margins and associated processes.},

abstract = {The 2-D crustal velocity model along the Hirapur-Mandla DSS profile across the Narmada-Son lineament in central India (MURTY et al., 1998) has been updated based on the analysis of some short and discontinuous seismic wide-angle reflection phases. Three layers, with seismic velocities of 6.5-6.7, 6.35-6.40 and 6.8 km s-1, and upper boundaries located approximately at 8, 17 and 22 km depth respectively, have been identified between the basement (velocity 5.9 km s-1) and the uppermost mantle (velocity 7.8 km s-1 . The layer with 6.5-6.7 km s-1 velocity is thin and is less than 2-km deep between the Narmada north (at Katangi) and south (at Jabalpur) faults. The upper crust shows a horst feature between these faults, which indicates that the Narmada zone acts as a ridge between two pockets of mafic intrusion in the upper crust. The Moho boundary, at 40-44 km depth and the intra-crustal layers exhibit an upwarp suggesting that the Narmada faults have deep origins, involving deep-seated tectonics. A smaller intrusive thickness between the Narmada faults, as compared to those beyond these faults, suggests that the intrusive activities on the two sides are independent. This further suggests that the two Narmada faults may have been active at different geological times. The seismic model is constrained by 2-D gravity modeling. The gravity highs on either side of the Narmada zone are due to the effect of the high velocity/high density mafic intrusion at upper crustal level.},

Archean terrains (Eastern Dharwar, Bastar, Bundelkhand and Aravalli cratons) are underlain by crust with felsic-intermediate composition (Vinfp/inf/Vinfs/inf ∼ 1.65-1.75) in contrast to mafic composition (Vinfp/inf/Vinfs/inf 1.78) of crust beneath Vindhyan basin, Godavari basin, and the Narmada-Son Lineament (NSL) of Proterozoic age. The Moho depth varies between 33 and 43 km with no definite relationship with age of the crust. Duplex Moho with highly mafic underplated lower crust is characteristic feature of the NSL, signifying its paleo-rift character. Present day felsic character of the Indian Archean crust could be a consequence of post-formation modification of the initial mafic lower crust through the process of lithospheric delamination. This major tectonic event also created layered lithosphere beneath parts of India imprinted as positive velocity contrast at a depth of ∼80 km, usually referred to as Hales discontinuity. The upper part of the lithosphere has shear velocity (Vinfs/inf) ∼4.52 km/s and the lower one ∼4.77 km/s. We speculate that such a layered lithosphere could be due to a low-density, depleted spinel peridotite (with Archean affinity) lying over higher density fertile garnet peridotite of Proterozoic age. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Earthquake stability assessment of large opencast mine slopes are complex and non-linear problems, often addressed using pseudo-static approaches neglecting material-induced failures and the role of pore-fluids. In this study, a numerical approach is used to understand the dynamic response of saturated and partially saturated soils. For this purpose user-defined elements have been implemented in Abaqus/Standard including user-defined material models. The governing equations involving coupled fluid flow and finite deformation processes in partially saturated soils are derived within the framework of the Theory of Porous Media. The stress-strain behavior of granular soils is represented by a hypoplastic constitutive model and for clayey soils the ISA-Clay model is used. The saturation-suction behavior is modeled using the van Genuchten model. To account for the large scale of the finite element model, a scaling procedure of the system of equations is proposed to purge the influence of initial stress. The performance of the user-defined elements is tested by back analysis of a centrifuge test available in the literature. Finally, large-scale fully coupled finite element simulations are performed to study the response of a flooded opencast mine under earthquake loading. The paper illustrates the importance of accounting the pore-fluids as independent phases in the context of seismic analysis of slopes and the influence of simplifications on which the calculation is based are highlighted. The simulations show strong wave diffraction effects for inhomogeneous dump structures, resulting in smaller displacements in near-surface areas of the slope. Further it was found that large areas of the dump show a temporary decrease of effective stress. The initial strong differences in stiffness between the different materials may decrease with time after several seismic events due stress redistributions caused by earthquakes.},

Hence, selection of ratings is very important in the preparation of LSZ maps. Here, seven layers/factors viz. aspect, elevation, geology, slope, soil, distance from stream, distance from thrusts are considered for LSZ mapping in Mandakini River basin, Uttarakhand containing 1,805,636 pixels. The weights were calculated using information value (InfoVal) method. The occurrences of landslides (2009 pixels) until 2008 were considered for training of model. Thus for giving rating to each thematic layer, 7! = 5040 permutations (ratings) are possible. Hence, 5040 LSZ maps were prepared and out of them, the best rating was identified using fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) and binary logistic regression (LR). FDA and LR gave similar ratings and the correlation (r},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Continental collision is an intrinsic feature of plate tectonics. The closure of an oceanic basin leads to the onset of subduction of buoyant continental material, which slows down and eventually stops the subduction process. In natural cases, evidence of advancing margins has been recognized in continental collision zones such as India-Eurasia and Arabia-Eurasia. We perform a parametric study of the geometrical and rheological influence on subduction dynamics during the subduction of continental lithosphere. In our 2-D numerical models of a free subduction system with temperature and stress-dependent rheology, the trench and the overriding plate move self-consistently as a function of the dynamics of the system (i.e. no external forces are imposed). This setup enables to study how continental subduction influences the trench migration. We found that in all models the slab starts to advance once the continent enters the subduction zone and continues to migrate until few million years after the ultimate slab detachment. Our results support the idea that the advancing mode is favoured and, in part, provided by the intrinsic force balance of continental collision. We suggest that the advance is first induced by the locking of the subduction zone and the subsequent steepening of the slab, and next by the sinking of the deepest oceanic part of the slab, during stretching and break-off of the slab. These processes are responsible for the migration of the subduction zone by triggering small-scale convection cells in the mantle that, in turn, drag the plates. The amount of advance ranges from 40 to 220 km and depends on the dip angle of the slab before the onset of collision.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Embedded in this concept, the model under consideration represents a triphasic medium of a cohesive-frictional elastoplastic solid skeleton and a binary pore-fluid, which is composed of a materially incompressible liquid (wetting phase) and a materially compressible gas (nonwetting phase). The unsaturated domain (saturation in terms of liquid saturation) of the porous medium is included in the model by the application of a capillary-pressure-saturation relation, which takes into account the interaction of the solid skeleton and the two pore-fluids. Furthermore, the interaction is described by Darcy's filter law including a relative permeability, which depends on the deformation of the pore space and the degree of saturation. Finally, a corresponding finite element formulation is presented and applied to a volumetrically strongly coupled solid-fluid-problem. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The Imphal valley, located in the central part of the IBR, has a sedimentary thickness of 2.5 km. The Poisson's ratio values correlate well with the tectonic units comprises the subduction region. We observed high Poisson's ratio values throughout the region, which reflects bulk mafic to ultramafic crustal composition.

abstract = {Characteristics of ground motions generated during an earthquake (EQ) alter between bedrock and the surface depending upon subsoil properties. Such modifications in the ground motion characteristics are termed as local site effects. Building response as well as induced effects of EQs are thus controlled by these modified ground motions at the surface. Hence, addressing the local site effect known as site response analysis is of considerable importance for any region. Numerically, site response analysis can be performed using linear, equivalent linear and nonlinear methodologies. Amongst these three methodologies, equivalent linear method of site response analysis is widely followed because of its simplicity and reasonable accuracy. At present, there are numerous softwares and codes which can perform site response analysis following equivalent linear methodology. Some of these softwares are; SHAKE2000, EERA and DEEPSOIL. In this work, a new MATLAB code is developed which can perform equivalent linear site response analysis in the frequency domain. New code is developed in such a way that the response in user specified layers can be shown together for better comparison and understanding. All the response parameters (Fourier spectrum, strain time history, amplification spectra, acceleration time history etc.) are shown in a single window so that the user can compare amongst them. Further, the numerical values of these response parameters can be obtained easily. In addition, limitation of underestimating high frequency ground motion by available equivalent linear analysis tool is overcome in the newly developed code. In order to validate the newly developed code, site response analyses carried out for a typical borehole using SHAKE2000 and newly developed code are compared and found closely matching.},

abstract = {The response of a boiling water reactor (BWR) nuclear containment vessel has been studied against commercial and fighter aircraft crash using a nonlinear finite element code ABAQUS. The aircrafts employed were Boeing 747-400, Boeing 767-400, Airbus A-320, Boeing 707-320 and Phantom F4. The containment was modeled as a three-dimensional deformable reinforced concrete structure while the loading of aircraft was assigned using the respective reaction-time curve. The location of strike was considered near the junction of dome and cylinder, and the angle of incidence, normal to the containment surface. The material behavior of the concrete was incorporated using the damaged plasticity model while that of the reinforcement, the Johnson-Cook elasto-viscoplastic model. The containment could not sustain the impact of Boeing 747-400 and Boeing 767-400 aircrafts and suffered rupture of concrete around the impact region leading to global failure. On the other hand, the maximum local deformation at the point of impact was found to be 0.998 m, 0.099 m, 0.092 m, 0.089 m, and 0.074 m against Boeing 747-400, Phantom F4, Boeing 767, Boeing 707-320 and Airbus A-320 aircrafts respectively. The results of the present study were compared with those of the previous analytical and numerical investigations with respect to the maximum deformation and overall behavior of the containment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Liquefaction-induced surface effects are identified by measuring the increase in moisture content of the area with respect to the low moisture content of the surrounding area. In this study, satellite image/ data, LANDSAT 7 is acquired for EQ affected area before and after the EQ. These images contain data of different bands information in terms of Digital Numbers (DN). The DN is first converted to Radiance. The value of the radiance is affected by the atmospheric condition of the area. So, atmospheric correction is carried out by using the FLAASH module in ENVI software. The thermal infrared spectrum of the satellite data is used for calculating the radiant temperature. With the help of Planck's radiation equation, spectral radiance is converted to the temperature. As soil surface temperature decreases with increasing soil water content, it can be correlated with soil moisture content. After finding the soil moisture content, the pre and/or post-earthquake(EQ) satellite are compared to find out the changes. On the basis of the changes and soil moisture contain difference between nearby area the probable post EQ liquefaction features positions are found out for the region.},

abstract = {As the depth of exploitation increases, studies on constitutive models of rock affected by temperature and humidity become very important. Based on the Nishihara model, a visco-elastic-plastic rock model was established by using the coefficients of thermal and humidity expansion, thermal viscosity attenuation, humid viscosity attenuation and acceleration rheology components. We used the definition of a controlled heat circle to explain the model. The results show that the behavior of rock, affected by temperature and humidity, is stable as a function of time when the stress is lower than the first yield stress $\sigma$S1; the creep rate will increase due to the effect of temperature and humidity when the stress is greater than or equal to $\sigma$S1; the creep rate will accelerate at an increasing rate when the stress is greater than or equal to the second yield stress $\sigma$S2, which results in a failure of the roadway. The model derived in this study can completely describe visco-elastic-plastic characteristics and reflects the three stages of rock creep. {\textcopyright} 2010 China University of Mining and Technology.},

abstract = {The sources of lithospheric stress and their distinctive features are briefly reviewed. It is suggested that there are two main categories of lithospheric stress: renewable stress which persists despite continuing stress relaxation and non-renewable stress which can be dissipated by relief of the initial strain. The two most important types of renewable stress arise from plate boundary forces and from isostatically compensated loads. Non-renewable stress systems include bending stresses, membrane stresses and thermal stresses. An important phenomenon generating large stresses at shallow depth is stress amplification caused by lower lithospheric creep. This applies to renewable stresses but not to the non-renewable type. It is suggested that only renewable stresses contribute significantly to tectonic activity. However, bending and thermal stresses are locally important in subducting lithosphere. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

The Narmada-Son-lineament region in central India has experienced two such events, the 1938 Satpura earthquake and the 1997 Jabalpur earthquake, having a focal depth of more than 35 km. We have estimated elastic stresses due to the crustal density and mechanical properties heterogeneities along the Hirapur-Mandla profile passing through the Jabalpur earthquake region to analyse conditions suitable for the concentration of shear stresses in the hypocentral region of this earthquake. Elastic stresses have been computed by a finite element method for a range of material parameters. The results indicate that the shear stresses generated by the density heterogeneities alone are not able to locally enhance the stress concentration in the hypocentral region. The role of mechanical properties of various crustal layers is important in achieving this localization of stresses. Among a range of material parameters analysed, the model with a mechanically strong lower crust overlying a relatively weak sub-Moho layer is able to enhance the stress concentration in the hypocentral region, implying a weaker mantle in comparison to the lower crust this region of central India.},

Though the earlier geophysical examinations provide some vital information about its crustal configuration, its origin and evolution have remained unsolved. Using the available seismic information, the present 2-D together with 3-D gravity modelings of the Laxmi Ridge crust/mantle system brought out a transitional layer between the depth of 11-22 km. This anomalous layer is not confined beneath the ridge axis but found to be present in the entire eastern basin and interpreted as a massive mafic intrusion beneath the region. Thickness of this layer at the base of the crust beneath the Laxmi Ridge decreases gradually towards the north-west. However, its extension towards the southeast and ultimate connection with the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge makes the western boundary of the magmatic crustal accretion along the west coast of India. It is suggested that the Deccan plume head mushrooming beneath the region has modified the crust with a huge magmatic intrusion. The then spreading centre coupled with the Deccan volcanic eruption is held responsible for the present day configuration of the Laxmi Ridge.},

Out of these 330 events, seismograms of 163 events are selected for the SWS analysis. Relatively small average delay times (0.039–0.084 s) indicate existence of moderate crack density in the crust below the study area. It is found that fast polarization directions vary from station to station depending on the regional stress system as well as geological conditions. The spatial pattern of crustal anisotropy in the area is controlled mostly by tectonic movement of the Indian plate towards NE. Presence of several E-W and N-S trending active faults in the area also play an important role on the observed pattern of crustal anisotropy.},

abstract = {Summary. The wavelength and amplitude of outer rises seaward of sub‐duction zones and arches surrounding islands and seamounts are used to parameterize flexure profiles in terms of the moment and curvature at the first zero crossing. The data show the clear age dependence in the mechanical thickness of the lithosphere up to 60–100Myr. Saturation of moment at large curvature is interpreted in terms of a depth‐dependent yield strength for the lithosphere using relations adopted from laboratory experiments of rock deformation. A comparison of theoretical curves with observed moments indicates that old oceanic lithosphere has no long‐term strength below about 40 km depth, with no difference between 100 and 165 Myr old crust. Moderate axial loading forces (±200 MPa) can explain most variations in the moment/curvature observations, except in the case of the Kuril Trench which appears anomalous given the age of the crust. Regional tension causes greater variability in moment as compared to regional compression because of the greater slope in the brittle failure envelope under tension. The observations point to a lithosphere weaker than the prediction from experimental deformation of rocks. Of the possible weakening mechanisms, elevated pore‐fluid pressure on faults does not predict the correct age dependence and is incompatible with earthquake focal mechanisms. Our favoured explanation is that the activation energy, Q, appropriate for ductile flow at geological strain rates is lower than the values derived from laboratory extrapolations of dry olivine data taken at high temperatures. If recent oceanic geotherms are reliable, Q in the lower lithosphere must be lower than 100kcal mol−1. The method used here is most appropriate for trench profiles with curvatures greater than 10−7m−1. For lower curvatures, such as along seamount profiles, small errors in the curvature estimate cause large changes in rheological parameters. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1982, Wiley Blackwell.

In our experiments, slab break-off occurs after the entrance of buoyant material at trench causing a slowing down of the subduction and producing an increase of the shortening rate and a transient episode of subduction dip reversal. We discuss the potential application of these processes to the recent collisional evolution of the Alps proposing that the rupture of the slab produced a reorganization of the belt with a transition from one sided to a doubly vergent orogen. {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract = {The numerical modelling of plate subduction requires solving a coupled thermo-mechanical highly-nonlinear transient problem. The mechanical description of the phenomenon results in a multiphase quasi-static Stokes flow, where the inertia terms are neglected. The transient thermal problem is dominated by the advection term. Here, the representation and evolution of the different phases are described using level sets. The phase tracking is carried out transporting the level set along with the material, using a pure advective model. The gradient discontinuities induced by the viscosity jump across the interface are resolved numerically by enriching the solution using a partition of unity method in a eXtended Finite Element Method (X-FEM) context. These numerical tools are used to simulate plate subduction with different parameters and to derive useful correlations between relevant geophysical factors. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We present an updated global earthquake catalogue for stable continental regions (SCRs; i.e. intraplate earthquakes) that is available on the Internet. Our database contains information on location, magnitude, seismic moment and focal mechanisms for over 1300 M (moment magnitude) ≥ 4.5 historic and instrumentally recorded crustal events. Using this updated earthquake database in combination with a recently published global catalogue of rifts, we assess the correlation of intraplate seismicity with ancient rifts on a global scale. Each tectonic event is put into one of five categories based on location: (i) interior rifts/taphrogens, (ii) rifted continental margins, (iii) non-rifted crust, (iv) possible interior rifts and (v) possible rifted margins. We find that approximately 27 per cent of all events are classified as interior rifts (i), 25 per cent are rifted continental margins (ii), 36 per cent are within non-rifted crust (iii) and 12 per cent (iv and v) remain uncertain. Thus, over half (52 per cent) of all events are associated with rifted crust, although within the continental interiors (i.e. away from continental margins), non-rifted crust has experienced more earthquakes than interior rifts. No major change in distribution is found if only large (M ≥ 6.0) earthquakes are considered. The largest events (M ≥ 7.0) however, have occurred predominantly within rifts (50 per cent) and continental margins (43 per cent). Intraplate seismicity is not distributed evenly. Instead several zones of concentrated seismicity seem to exist. This is especially true for interior rifts/taphrogens, where a total of only 12 regions are responsible for 74 per cent of all events and as much as 98 per cent of all seismic moment released in that category. Of the four rifts/taphrogens that have experienced the largest earthquakes, seismicity within the Kutch rift, India, and the East China rift system, may be controlled by diffuse plate boundary deformation more than by the presence of the ancient rifts themselves. The St. Lawrence depression, Canada, besides being an ancient rift, is also the site of a major collisional suture. Thus only at the Reelfoot rift (New Madrid seismic zone, NMSZ, USA), is the presence of features associated with rifting itself the sole candidate for causing seismicity. Our results suggest that on a global scale, the correlation of seismicity within SCRs and ancient rifts has been overestimated in the past. Because the majority of models used to explain intraplate seismicity have focused on seismicity within rifts, we conclude that a shift in attention more towards non-rifted as well as rifted crust is in order. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

abstract = {The behaviour of typical armour steel material under large strains, high strain rates and elevated temperatures needs to be investigated to analyse and reliably predict its response to various types of dynamic loading like impact. An empirical constitutive relation developed by Johnson and Cook (J-C) is widely used to capture strain rate sensitivity of the metals. A failure model proposed by Johnson and Cook is used to model the damage evolution and predict failure in many engineering materials. In this work, model constants of J-C constitutive relation and damage parameters of J-C failure model for a typical armour steel material have been determined experimentally from four types of uniaxial tensile test. Some modifications in the J-C damage model have been suggested and Finite Element simulation of three different tensile tests on armour steel specimens under dynamic strain rate (10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}), high triaxiality and elevated temperature respectively has been done in ABAQUS platform using the modified J-C failure model as user material sub-routine. The simulation results are validated by the experimental data. Thereafter, a moderately high strain rate event viz. Charpy impact test on armour steel specimen has been simulated using J-C material and failure models with the same material parameters. Reasonable agreement between the simulation and experimental results has been achieved.},

@article{Wang2013,
abstract = {Currently, inversion of geodetic data for earthquake fault ruptures is most based on a uniform half-space earth model because of its closed-form Green's functions. However, the layered structure of the crust can significantly affect the inversion results. The other effect, which is often neglected, is related to the curved fault geometry. Especially, fault planes of most mega thrust earthquakes vary their dip angle with depth from a few to several tens of degrees. Also the strike directions of many large earthquakes are variable. For simplicity, such curved fault geometry is usually approximated to several connected rectangular segments, leading to an artificial loss of the slip resolution and data fit. In this presentation, we introduce a free FORTRAN code incorporating with the layered crust structure and curved fault geometry in a user-friendly way. The name SDM stands for Steepest Descent Method, an iterative algorithm used for the constrained least-squares optimization. The new code can be used for joint inversion of different datasets, which may include systematic offsets, as most geodetic data are obtained from relative measurements. These offsets are treated as unknowns to be determined simultaneously with the slip unknowns. In addition, a-priori and physical constraints are considered. The a-priori constraint includes the upper limit of the slip amplitude and the variation range of the slip direction (rake angle) defined by the user. The physical constraint is needed to obtain a smooth slip model, which is realized through a smoothing term to be minimized with the misfit to data. In difference to most previous inversion codes, the smoothing can be optionally applied to slip or stress-drop. The code works with an input file, a well-documented example of which is provided with the source code. Application examples are demonstrated.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. It is noticed that few geophysical studies have been carried out to decipher the crustal structure of southwestern part of the Northeast India comprising of Tripura fold belt and Bengal basin as compared to the Shillong plateau and the Brahmaputra basin. This region has a long history of seismicity that is still continuing. We have determined first-order crustal features in terms of Moho depths (H) and average V P /V S ratios ({\$}\kappa{\$}) using H-{\$}\kappa{\$} stacking technique. The inversion of receiver functions data yields near surface thick sedimentary layer in the Bengal basin, which is nearly absent in the Shillong plateau and Tripura fold belt. Our result suggests that the crust is thicker (38–45 km) in the Tripura fold belt region with higher shear-wave velocity in the lower crust than the Shillong plateau. The distribution of V P /V S ratio indicates heterogeneity throughout the whole region. While low to medium value of Poisson's ratio (1.69–1.75) indicates the presence of felsic crust in the Shillong plateau of the extended Indian Archean crust. The medium to high values of V P /V S ratio ( {\textgreater}1.780) in the Bengal basin and the Tripura fold belt region represent mafic crust during the formation of the Bengal delta and the Tripura fold belt creation in the Precambrian to the Permian age. The depth of the sediments in the Bengal basin is up to 8 km on its eastern margin, which get shallower toward its northeastern and southeastern margins.},

abstract = {Consistent and reasonable characterization of the material behavior under the coupled effects of strain, strain rate and temperature on the material flow stress is remarkably crucial in order to design as well as optimize the process parameters in the metal forming industrial practice. The objective of this work was to formulate an appropriate flow stress model to characterize the flow behavior of AISI-1045 medium carbon steel over a practical range of deformation temperatures (650-950 °C) and strain rates (0.05-1.0 s-1). Subsequently, the Johnson-Cook flow stress model was adopted for modeling and predicting the material flow behavior at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, surrogate models were developed based on the constitutive relations, and the model constants were estimated using the experimental results. As a result, the constitutive flow stress model was formed and the constructed model was examined systematically against experimental data by both numerical and graphical validations. In addition, to predict the material damage behavior, the failure model proposed by Johnson and Cook was used, and to determine the model parameters, seven different specimens, including flat, smooth round bars and pre-notched specimens, were tested at room temperature under quasi strain rate conditions. From the results, it can be seen that the developed model over predicts the material behavior at a low temperature for all strain rates. However, overall, the developed model can produce a fairly accurate and precise estimation of flow behavior with good correlation to the experimental data under high temperature conditions. Furthermore, the damage model parameters estimated in this research can be used to model the metal forming simulations, and valuable prediction results for the work material can be achieved.},

However, as there was no coincident wide-angle/refraction input/well data input, no velocity picture could be derived to supplement the reflection results. In the present study, as velocity information is very important for a realistic analysis of the reflection time sections, we have used the interval velocity derived from stack velocities (Hurbal, P. and Krey, T., 1980.

This was followed by dynamic forward modeling, using the interval velocity model as the starting model. The resultant velocity depth section has a four-layer structure. One of the layers (third) is a low-velocity layer. The lateral extension of this layer vis-{\`{a}}-vis with other layers is presented, for a better understanding of the structure and tectonics of the Aravalli-Delhi fold belt. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {In the present study, the emphasis is made on the seismic performance of nuclear containment constructed on layered medium to dense silty sand soil considering the nonlinearity of the containment structure using the concrete damage plas- ticity (CDP) model and Drucker–Prager plastic model for soil. The finite element model is prepared using the ABAQUS. From the static pushover analysis, it is noticed that yielding force is reduced up to 8.37{\%} and 2.37{\%} in the case of with and without embedment, respectively, as compared to a fixed base. Furthermore, incremental dynamic analysis is performed for the motion range of 0.1 g to 0.6 g, corresponding to the fundamental frequency. For the dynamic analysis, Kelvin element is used at boundaries to incorporate the truncated soil mass. The results are shown in the form of base shear, base moment and displacement ductility, drift ratio, normalized peak settlement, and normalized peak foundation sliding. Moment demand is reduced up to 25.89{\%} and 51.31{\%} in the case of with and without embedment, respectively, as compared to a fixed base. Similarly, base shear demand is increased up to 21.85{\%} in the case of with embedment. It may reduce up to 29.08{\%} in the case of without embedment of foundation as compared to a fixed base. Drift demand of nuclear power plant (NPP) structure is increased up to 14.47{\%} and 38.16{\%} in the case of with and without embedment of foundation, respectively, as compared to a fixed base. In contrast, displacement ductility demand reduced up to 47.95{\%} and 57.52{\%} in the case of with and without embedment of foundation, respectively. Settlement demand is increased linearly in the case of with embedment with respect to ground motion intensity; however, it increases sharply for ground motion intensity {\textgreater} 0.3 g in the case of without embed- ment. The sliding demand of foundation increase with a low and fixed amount of sliding is examined in the condition of with embedment case; however, it rises steeply in the case of without embedment case, indicating that without considering the embedment effect may increase the design requirement and therefore lead to uneconomical designing. The effect of the CDP model shows the need to consider the nonlinearity of structure along with the nonlinearity of soil.},

abstract = {Standard scientific operations on Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 204 documented a horizon of massive gas hydrate and highly saline pore water ∼0-20 m below the southern summit of Hydrate Ridge offshore Oregon. The sediment zone lies near active seafloor gas venting, raising the possibility that free gas co-exists with gas hydrate in shallow subsurface layers where pore waters have become too saline to precipitate additional gas hydrate. Here we discuss a unique experiment that addresses this important concept. A 1-m-long pressurized core was retrieved from ∼14 m below sea floor at Site 1249 and slowly degassed at ∼0 °C in the laboratory over ∼178 h to determine in situ salinity and gas concentrations in the interval of massive gas hydrate. The core released ∼95 l of gas (predominantly methane), by far the greatest gas volume ever measured for a 1 m core at ambient shipboard pressure and temperature conditions. Geochemical mass-balance calculations and the pressure of initial gas release (4.2 MPa) both imply that pore waters had an in situ salinity approaching or exceeding 105 g kg-1, the approximate salinity required for a gas hydrate-free gas-brine system. Relatively high concentrations of propane and higher hydrocarbon gases at the start of core degassing also suggest the presence of in situ free gas. Gas hydrate, free gas and brine likely co-exist in shallow sediment of Hydrate Ridge. Near-seafloor brines, produced when rapid gas hydrate crystallization extracts large quantities of water, impact the distribution and cycling of gas and gas hydrate in this region and perhaps elsewhere. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The numerical modelling of plate subduction requires solving a coupled thermo-mechanical highly-nonlinear transient problem. The mechanical description of the phenomenon results in a multiphase quasi-static Stokes flow, where the inertia terms are neglected. The transient thermal problem is dominated by the advection term. Here, the representation and evolution of the different phases are described using level sets. The phase tracking is carried out transporting the level set along with the material, using a pure advective model. The gradient discontinuities induced by the viscosity jump across the interface are resolved numerically by enriching the solution using a partition of unity method in a eXtended Finite Element Method (X-FEM) context. These numerical tools are used to simulate plate subduction with different parameters and to derive useful correlations between relevant geophysical factors. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The models considered include a three-surface kinematic hardening elastoplastic model; the CLoE hypoplastic model; a recently proposed K-hypoplastic model for clays, and an enhanced version of the same model incorporating the concept of intergranular strain. A clear qualitative picture of the relative performance of the different models as a function of the loading direction is obtained by means of the incremental strain response envelopes. The definition of suitable error measures allows to obtain further quantitative information in this respect. For the particular initial conditions and loading programme considered in this study, the kinematic hardening and the enhanced K-hypoplastic models appear to provide the best performance overall.},

The width of the Main Himalayan Thrust is quantified along the arc, together with estimates for the bounding coordinates of historical rupture zones, convergence rates, rupture propagation directions as constrained by felt intensities. The 2018 slip potential for fifteen segments of the Himalaya are evaluated and potential magnitudes assessed for future earthquakes should these segments fail in isolation or as contiguous ruptures. Ten of these fifteen segments are sufficiently mature currently to host a great earthquake (Mw ≥ 8). Fatal Himalayan earthquakes have in the past occurred mostly in the daylight hours. The death toll from a future nocturnal earthquake in the Himalaya could possibly exceed 100 000 due to increased populations and the vulnerability of present-day construction methods.},

abstract = {The paper presents the results of a numerical simulation for the strains and damage caused by the drop of a TUK-128 SNF shipping cask on a bar. This is a design basis accident in the SNF land transport outside hazardous sites (an NPP or a processing plant). Strains caused by a cask drop on a bar are calculated and simulated in the elastoplastic behavior region of structural materials. The simulation results depend heavily on the method used for defining the plastic properties of materials. The most common way for taking account of plasticity is to set a tabulated function that gives the link between stresses and plastic strains. Such plasticity definition fails to take into account not only the temperature dependence of plasticity properties but also the kinematic strengthening of the material (dependence of yield strength on intensity of strains). However, this plasticity model leads to a major decrease in the complexity of computations which is especially important when dozens of design cases need to be analyzed. Another (more adequate) approach to plasticity definition is to take into account the change in the yield strength not only depending on the strain magnitude and intensity but also on temperature (Johnson–Cook plasticity model). In this case, 5 to 7 parameters need to be determined for each type of structural material. Presently, there is no well-defined way to determine these parameters; for this reason, the authors suggest a procedure for finding them. A drawback of this approach is a much greater complexity of computations. Therefore, the paper presents a comparative analysis of the calculation results with the plasticity definition by the Johnson–Cook model and using a tabulated function. Simulations were performed for two design cases: a drop with an impact on the cask lid (stainless steel) and a drop with an impact on the cask bottom (high-strength cast iron). The considered options to define plastic properties of structural materials are compared against the TUK-128 cask drop test results. The impact was simulated by finite element method using the LS-Dyna code.},

An example of an Eastern US nuclear power plant (NPP) is presented. The approach presented herein follows the current practice of the Individual Plant Examination for External Events (IPEEE) program in the US. The NPP is founded on a relatively soft soil deposit, and thus the SSI effects on seismic responses are significant. Probabilistic models used for the idealization of the seismic excitation and the surrounding soil deposit are described. Using a lognormal format, computed random variability effects were combined with those proposed in the SPRA methodology guidelines. Probabilistic floor response spectra and structural fragilities for different NPP buildings were computed. Structural capacities were determined following the current practice which assumes independent median safety factors for strength and inelastic absorption. Limitations of the IPEEE practice for performing SPRA are discussed and alternate procedures, more rigorous and simple to implement, are suggested. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {1 Exercise: Solving ODEs – Lorenz equations Reading • Spiegelman (2004), chap. 4 • Press et al. (1993), chap. 16 • Spencer and Ware (2008), sec. 16 We previously discussed the 4 th order Runge Kutta method as a simple method to solve initial value problems where the task is to forward integrate a vector y(t) from an initial condition y 0 (t = t 0) to some time t f while the time derivatives of y are given by dy dt (t) = f (t, y, C) (1) we made the dependence of f on constant parameters explicit in the C. Numerically, this is done by successively computing y n+1 for time t + h from the last known solution for y n at time t with time step h y n+1 ≈ y n + hy (h, t, y, C) (2) where y denotes the approximate time-derivatives for y. In a real application, we would use adaptive step-size control by means of error check-ing depending on the accuracy of our approximate method, or employ an entirely differ-ent approach (Press et al., 1993, sec. 16.2). Spencer and Ware (2008) discuss some of the algorithms that are implemented in MATLAB , and the problem set file rikitake.m 1 is an example for how to use the MATLAB function ode45. However, the Runge-Kutta is good example method and easy enough to implement. 1.1 The Lorenz equations solved with simple Runge Kutta As an interesting example of a three-dimensional (y = {\{}y 1 , y 2 , y 3 {\}}) ODE system, we will discuss the classic Lorenz (1963) equations. These equations are a simplified description of thermal convection in the atmosphere and an example of a low order, spectral numerical solution. They were also fundamental in the establishment of deterministic chaos theory. 1 All MATLAB files for all of the problem sets are at http://geodynamics.usc.edu/{\~{}}becker/ teaching-557.html.

abstract = {Seismicity and fault plane solutions of several earthquakes in the Bay of Bengal have been studied to focus attention on the nature of intraplate deformation in the northern Indian plate. A widely dispersed diffuse seismicity provides evidence that the intraplate region of the entire Bay of Bengal and peninsular India of the Indian plate are seismically active of which the Gangetic delta and the eastern flank of the Ninety East Ridge show somewhat higher seismicity in comparison to the thickly populated epicenters at the eastern plate boundary. Predominance of thrust faulting earthquake mechanisms with consistent north-dipping fault planes and more or less N-S pressure axes imply that N-S compression is more prevalent in the intraplate region of the Bay of Bengal which is analogous to the Himalayan arc. This intraplate seismicity and N-S compressive deformation is presumed to be the result of collisional resistance to the north moving Indian plate with the Eurasian plate at the Himalayas where subduction of the Indian lithosphere in mantle has stopped recently. As a result, to compensate the horizontal compressive force by ridge-push at the Carlsberg Ridge, the intraplate region of the northern Indian plate in continuation to the Central Indian Ocean Basin no longer remains passive due to a strong repulsive force at the collisonal plate boundary Himalaya that causes stress transmission towards south and makes the intraplate region seismically active.},

abstract = {Crustal thickness and Poisson's ratios were estimated at 13 broadband seismological stations established in a profile along the Kali river valley, Kumaon (Central) Himalaya. The seismological profile extends from the Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP) in the south to the Higher Himalaya in the north, passing through the Sub and Lesser Himalaya. The Receiver Function (RF) method has been adopted to investigate the crustal structure beneath the profile. Time domain iterative deconvolution method has been adopted for RF computation. The H-k stacking method has been adopted to analyze the RFs for obtaining average crustal thickness and Poisson's ratio ($\sigma$) of the crust beneath each station. The study reveals that the crustal thickness beneath the IGP is ∼38 km which gradually increases up to ∼41 km at the northernmost station located in the Higher Himalaya. The values of $\sigma$ vary from 0.23 to 0.28. The value of $\sigma$ is low in the Sub-Himalaya and outer Lesser Himalaya suggesting more of a felsic composition of crust. A Significantly high value of $\sigma$ (∼0.28) is observed in the Dharchula region of the Chiplakot Crystalline belt which is coincident with a large number of micro-to-moderate magnitude earthquakes forming a cluster at shallow to mid-crustal depths. The high Poisson's ratio is possibly due to the presence of fluids/partial melts at mid-crustal depth. The presence of fluids influences the rheological property and controls the mechanical and shear strength of crustal rocks producing a cluster of seismicity observed beneath the Dharchula region.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Plexiglass boxes filled with two immiscible fluids of known properties were used to test the spacing between domes and rate of growth of domes.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia. All rights reserved. The paper presents the probability of earthquake occurrences and forecasting of earthquake magnitudes size in northeast India, using four stochastic models (Gamma, Lognormal, Weibull and Log-logistic) and artificial neural networks, respectively considering updated earthquake catalogue of magnitude Mw ≥6.0 that occurred from year 1737 to 2015 in the study area. On the basis of past seismicity of the region, the conditional probabilities for the identified seismic source zones (12 sources) have been estimated using their best fit model and respective model parameters for various combinations of elapsed time (T) and time interval (t). It is observed that for elapsed time T=0 years, EBT and Kabaw zone shows highest conditional probability and it reaches 0.7 to 0.91 after about small time interval of 3-6 years (2014-2017; since last earthquake of Mw ≥6.0 occurred in the year 2011) for an earthquake magnitude Mw ≥6.0.Whereas, Sylhet zone shows lowest value of conditional probability among all twelve seismic source zones and it reaches 0.7 after about large time interval of 48 years (year 2045, since last event of Mw ≥6.0 occurred in the year 1999). While for elapsed time up to 2016 from the occurrence of the last earthquake of magnitude Mw ≥6.0, the MBT and MCT region shows highest conditional probability among all twelve seismic source zones and it reaches 0.88 to 0.91 after about 6-7 (2022-2023) years and in the same year (2022-2023) Sylhet zone shows lowest conditional probability and it reaches 0.14-0.17. However, we have proposed Artificial Neural Network (ANN) technique, which is based on feedforward backpropagation neural network model with single hidden layer to estimate the possible magnitude of future earthquake in  the identified seismic source zones. For conditional probability of earthquake occurrence above 0.8, the neural network gives the probable magnitude of future earthquake as Mw 6.6 in Churachandpur-Mao fault (CMF) region in the years 2014 to 2017, Mw 6.8 in Myanmar Central Basin (MCB) region in the years 2013 to 2016, Mw 6.5 in Eastern Boundary Thrust (EBT) and Kabaw region in the years 2015-2018, respectively. The epicentre of recently occurred 4 January 2016 Manipur earthquake (M 6.7), 13 April 2016 Myanmar earthquake (M 6.9) and the 24 August 2016 Myanmar earthquake (M 6.8) are located in Churachandpur-Mao fault (CMF) region Myanmar Central Basin (MCB) region and EBT and Kabaw region, respectively and that are the identified seismic source zones in the study area which show that the ANN model yields good forecasting accuracy.},

abstract = {Geomaterials generally show strain-softening characteristics after peak-load. Based on the triaxial test for sandy mudstone, a simple elastopeak plastic-strain-softening-damage model (EPSDM) was proposed. Compared with the traditional strain-softening model, EPSDM shows obvious plastic bearing characteristics before strain softening. Then, the closed-formed solution of circular opening was deduced based on the newly proposed model. A plastic shear strain increment was introduced as the extension constraint condition of peak plastic zone. The solution correctness of EPSDM was also verified by comparing with other research results. In addition, the solution based on EPSDM could degenerate for a series of results obtained by elastobrittle plastic model (EBM), elasto-strain-softening model (ESM), and elasto-perfectly plastic model (EPM) under certain conditions. Hence, it could be regarded as a unified solution. Finally, the research results denoted that when the inner pressure was fully released, the maximum postpeak failure radii and surface displacement of surrounding rock indicated the characteristics of EBM{\textgreater}ESM{\textgreater}EPSDM{\textgreater}EPM. Therefore, the plastic bearing behavior could effectively decrease the postpeak failure zone radii and surface displacement. The dilation coefficient noticeably influenced postpeak failure range and surface displacement, particularly the damage zone radii and tunnel wall convergence. The research results can provide very important theoretical bases for evaluating the tunnel stability and support design reliability for underground engineering.},

abstract = {Fundamental-mode Rayleigh and Love waves generated by nine earthquakes, which occurred in the central Indian Ocean (with epicentres extending to 40° S) and recorded at seven WWSSN stations of central Asia, have been used to determine the phase and group velocity along various paths across the northern and central Indian Ocean. The dispersion characteristics of Rayleigh and Love waves show a thick crust of 23 km thickness. This anomalous crustal thickening, having quasi continental-oceanic structure, may be explained by assuming the gradual transformation of top mantle material into material having either crustal like velocity or slightly lower than Moho velocity (P-wave velocity 7.72 km s-1, S-wave velocity 4.45 km s-1). The velocity structure down to a depth of 200 km has been obtained across the northern and central Indian Ocean. A low-velocity zone of 90 km with P-wave velocity of 7.85 km s-1 and S-wave velocity of 4.37 km s-1 is estimated to be centred at a depth of 78 km from the water surface. This low shear velocity in the mantle may be caused by the partial melting and elevated temperature there. The observed dispersion data for Rayleigh and Love waves also exhibit a strong anisotropy along different paths in the crust and upper mantle. The observed dispersion data for Rayleigh and Love waves that cross the Ninety-east Ridge are characterized by lower phase and group velocities, as compared to waves having paths in a more western direction than this ridge axis. However, the phase velocities for Rayleigh and Love waves are characterized by lower values across the Ninety-east Ridge, as compared to the normal oceanic structure. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {In central Mexico some significant normal faulting events have occurred within the subducted oceanic Cocos plate, just below or near the down-dip edge of the strongly coupled interface. These normal faulting shocks followed large shallow thrust earthquakes. In other subduction zones such events generally precede the up-dip thrust events. A vertical 2-D finite element modelling has been used to simulate the subduction of the Cocos plate beneath the North American plate when the slab is driven by an active convergence velocity or slab pull. We find that the latter mechanism plays only a minor role due to shallow subduction. The modelling results show that the stress pattern is very sensitive to the geometry of the plates. In particular, normal faulting earthquakes that follow large thrust events can be explained on the basis of the flexural response of the overriding and subducting plates to the peculiar geometry of this subduction zone, where the subducting slab becomes horizontal at about 100 km from the trench. This horizontal part of the subducting plate, down-dip with respect to the main thrust zone, is under an extensional stress field. This provides an alternative explanation to the slab pull for the occurrence of normal faulting intraplate earthquakes. In order for normal faulting earthquakes to occur in the early part of the seismic cycle, it is necessary that the large up-dip thrust events have a partial stress drop. We find that for small fractional stress drop, a wide region of extension remains below the down-dip edge of the main fault plane following a large thrust earthquake. Thus, the main thrust earthquakes do not invert the polarity of the active stress field, which is compressional and extensional up-dip and down-dip, respectively, with respect to the main thrust fault. Larger fractional stress drops result in larger delays in the occurrence of normal faulting events after the main thrust events.},

abstract = {Well-documented historical earthquake data from 1340 to 1983 has been analyzed and reported in this work so as to understand the seismicity and associated phenomena of Peninsular India. It has been the belief among earth scientists that the Peninsular Shield is aseismic, as the region attained stability long ago. However, the earthquake at Koyna (10 December 1967), Bhadrachalam (13 April 1969), Broach (23 March 1970), Hyderabad (30 June 1983) etc., altered this concept and it has now widely accepted that seismic activity is still continuing on a mild scale. As such, a need has arisen to take into consideration historical as well as recent seismological data to study the seismic status of Peninsular India. Using the well-known 'frequency-magnitude" relation of Gutenberg and Richter (1954), an attempt has been made to derive "a" and "b" and the ratio (a/b). The values as obtained for Peninsular India are 4.4, 0.85, and 5.17, which are typical of moderately active zones the world over. Recurrence periods of earthquake magnitude 6.75 and 7.0 are calculated to be 21 and 35 yr, respectively. Further, the historical seismicity correlates well with the protocontinents such as Dharwar, Aravalli, and Singhbhum in the Peninsular Shield. It is observed that seismicity in a broad sense is defined by the protocontinents with low intracontinental seis- micity, while the lineaments and rift valleys are from zones of moderate seismicity.

abstract = {A probabilistic neural network (PNN) is presented for predicting the magnitude of the largest earthquake in a pre-defined future time period in a seismic region using eight mathematically computed parameters known as seismicity indicators. The indicators considered are the time elapsed during a particular number (n) of significant seismic events before the month in question, the slope of the Gutenberg-Richter inverse power law curve for the n events, the mean square deviation about the regression line based on the Gutenberg-Richter inverse power law for the n events, the average magnitude of the last n events, the difference between the observed maximum magnitude among the last n events and that expected through the Gutenberg-Richter relationship known as the magnitude deficit, the rate of square root of seismic energy released during the n events, the mean time or period between characteristic events, and the coefficient of variation of the mean time. Prediction accuracies of the model are evaluated using three different statistical measures: the probability of detection, the false alarm ratio, and the true skill score or R score. The PNN model is trained and tested using data for the Southern California region. The model yields good prediction accuracies for earthquakes of magnitude between 4.5 and 6.0. The PNN model presented in this paper complements the recurrent neural network model developed by the authors previously, where good results were reported for predicting earthquakes with magnitude greater than 6.0. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Regional surface gravity data and global satellite magnetic data have been utilized to generate a preliminary model of the crustal structure along a southwest-northeast profile (Gadra-Fatehpur) through western Rajasthan. The study area represents the western part of the Indian continental landmass which has undergone several major episodes of repeated subduction/collision, plume traces and rifting from Archaean to recent times. The temporal and spatial relationship between the various geotectonic provinces is quite complex, thereby limiting the emergence of a suitable crustal structure model for this region. Exposures of the Malani Igneous Suite (MIS), a product of bimodal volcanism (∼780 Ma), and considered to be the third largest felsic magmatic province of the world, is evident along the profile and also to the southwest of the study area. The easternmost part of the profile is close to the DAFB (Delhi Aravalli Fold Belt), a Proterozoic orogenic belt. This study probes the geometry of the different crustal units in terms of density and susceptibility variations in order to decipher the imprints of the major tectonic processes the region has undergone. In order to decipher the crustal geometry of the Gadra-Fatehpur profile, two NW-SE gravity and magnetic profile vertical sections (A-A′ in the south and B-B′ in the north) are modelled on the basis of the constraints provided from previous seismic models. The crustal model of the Gadra-Fatehpur profile is composed of alluvium, Tertiary sediments, MIS, Marwar Supergroup, low-density layers (LDLs) and the middle-lower crustal layers, with a distinct change in configuration from the southwest to northeast. The Moho dips from SW to NE, the MIS in the SW gives way to the thick pile of the Marwar Supergroup to the NE. The evolution of MIS has been suggested to have occurred as a consequence of delamination of the upper mantle. LDLs are incorporated in Gadra-Fatehpur model. In the SW, LDL (2550 kg/m3) lies below the MIS in the NE, another LDL (2604 kg/m3) is depicted below the mid-crustal layer.{\textcopyright} 2013, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

abstract = {The seismic hazard in the Gujarat region has been evaluated. The scenario hazard maps showing the spatial distribution of various parameters like peak ground acceleration, characteristics site frequency and spectral acceleration for different periods have been presented. These parameters have been extracted from the simulated earthquake strong ground motions. The expected damage to buildings from future large earthquakes in Gujarat region has been estimated. It has been observed that the seismic hazard of Kachchh region is more in comparison with Saurashtra and mainland. All the cities of Kachchh can expect peak acceleration in excess of 500 cm/s2 at surface in case of future large earthquakes from major faults in Kachchh region. The cities of Saurashtra can expect accelerations of less than 200 cm/s2 at surface. The mainland Gujarat is having the lowest seismic hazard as compared with other two regions of Gujarat. The expected accelerations are less than 50 cm/s2 at most of the places. The single- and double-story buildings in Kachchh region are at highest risk as they can expect large accelerations corresponding to natural periods of such small structures. Such structures are relatively safe in mainland region. The buildings of 3-4 stories and tall structures that exist mostly in cities of Saurashtra and mainland can expect accelerations in excess of 100 cm/s2 during a large earthquake in Kachchh region. It has been found that a total of 0.11 million buildings in Rajkot taluka of Saurashtra are vulnerable to total damage. In Kachchh region, 0.37 million buildings are vulnerable. Most vulnerable talukas are Bhuj, Anjar, Rapar, Bhachau, and Mandvi in Kachchh district and Rajkot, Junagadh, Jamnagar, Surendernagar and Porbandar in Saurashtra. In mainland region, buildings in Bharuch taluka are more vulnerable due to proximity to active Narmada-Son geo-fracture. The scenario hazard maps presented in this study for moderate as well as large earthquakes in the region may be used to augment the information available in the probabilistic seismic hazard maps of the region. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

SV receiver functions for these stations have been computed and modelled down to the Moho level in terms of Poisson's ratio and shear wave velocities. Results show that the crust for the entire Dharwar craton is mainly simple, and has a low (about 0.25) Poisson ratio. It is usually thinner and less complex than the adjacent Proterozoic crust. However, the western Dharwar craton crust (thickness ∼41 km) with a gradational Moho boundary, is substantially ({\textgreater}7 km) thicker than its eastern counterpart (thickness ∼34 km). No substantial differences in average crustal S velocities (3.6-3.8 km s-1) were found. The eastern Dharwar crust below the Proterozoic Cuddapah basin was also found to have remained relatively simple and undisturbed. The continental margin to the west of the Dharwar craton appears to have shifted further west off the coast, where a possible west coast fault has down-thrown a continental crustal block under the seas. The crust constituting the Deccan volcanic province in the western Indian shield is found to be similar to that of the eastern Dharwar craton. The crust underneath the neighbouring Godavari graben is significantly different from the Dharwar crust and resembles that of a typical rift-valley.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the contemporaneous and palaeo-orientation of maximum horizontal compressive stress (SHmax) in the Earth's crust is important for the exploration and recovery of hydrocarbons and also provides insights into the mechanisms driving plate motion and intra-plate seismicity. To date, most approaches for modelling intraplate stress orientations have been based on applying forces to homogeneous elastic plates. However, real tectonic plates consist of oceanic and continental lithosphere, including sedimentary basins, fold belts and cratons with large differences in elastic properties. We have used the finite-element method as implemented in the software package ABAQUS™ along with the optimisation software Nimrod/O to model the orientations and magnitudes of SHmax over the Indo-Australian plate for the present and the Miocene. An elastic 2D plane stress model incorporating realistic mechanical properties for the Australian continent was used consisting of 24,400 elements, providing a resolution of 0.2° in both latitude and longitude. In general, modelled SHmax directions correlate well with observed contemporary stress indicator data and reactivation histories over the NW Shelf and Bass Strait regions of the Australian continent, where Tertiary tectonic reactivation through time is best documented. Large perturbations in SHmax orientation over the Australian continent are shown to occur in and around regions of heterogeneous material properties. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A finite element formulation and algorithm for the nonlinear analysis of the large deflection, materially nonlinear response of impulsively loaded shells is presented. A unique feature of this algorithm is the use of a bilinear four-node quadrilateral element with single-point quadrature and a simple hourglass control which is orthogonal to rigid body modes on an element level and does not compromise the consistency of the equations. The geometric nonlinearities are treated by using a corotational description wherein a coordinate system that rotates with the material is embedded at the integration point; thus the algorithm is directly applicable to anisotropic materials without any corrections for frame invariance of material property tensors. This algorithm can treat about 200 element-time-steps per CPU second on a CYBER 170/730 computer in the explicit time integration mode. Numerous results are presented for both elastic and elastic-plastic problems with large strains that show that the method in most cases is comparable in accuracy with an earlier version of this algorithm employing a cubic triangular plate-shell element, but substantially faster. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {We present lithospheric-scale analog models, investigating how the absolute plates' motion and subduction of buoyant oceanic plateaus can affect both the kinematics and the geometry of subduction, possibly resulting in the appearance of flat slab segments, and how it changes the overriding plate tectonic regime. Experiments suggest that flat subductions only occur if a large amount of a buoyant slab segment is forced into subduction by kinematic boundary conditions, part of the buoyant plateau being incorporated in the steep part of the slab to balance the negative buoyancy of the dense oceanic slab. Slab flattening is a long-term process (∼10 Ma), which requires the subduction of hundreds of kilometers of buoyant plateau. The overriding plate shortening rate increases if the oceanic plateau is large enough to decrease the slab pull effect. Slab flattening increases the interplate friction force and results in migration of the shortening zone within the interior of the overriding plate. The increase of the overriding plate topography close to the trench results from (1) the buoyancy of the plate subducting at trench and (2) the overriding plate shortening. Experiments are compared to the South American active margin, where two major horizontal slab segments had formed since the Pliocene. Along the South American subduction zone, flat slab segments below Peru and central Chile/NW Argentina appeared at ∼7 Ma following the beginning of buoyant slab segments' subduction. In northern Ecuador and northern Chile, the process of slab flattening resulting from the Carnegie and Iquique ridges' subductions, respectively, seems to be active but not completed. The formation of flat slab segments below South America from the Pliocene may explain the deceleration of the Nazca plate trenchward velocity. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

It marks the possible suture between two contrasting geological settings termed proto-continents lying to the North and South of it. Various views prevail about the nature of the rift zone. The present study delineates the seismic structure of the crust using P wave receiver functions at 10 broadband seismic stations installed along a profile across the NSL. The results from Common Conversion Point (CCP) stacking reveal a near continuous image of the Moho boundary, with the amplitudes of the Ps conversions from the Moho being weaker at stations within the rift. Modelling the receiver functions employing nearest neighborhood algorithm approach brings out a distinct (15. km) thickening of the crust and a complex nature of the Moho within the rifted zone. We find that the backazimuthal variations of the SV and SH receiver functions at the permanent station Jabalpur can be explained better by introducing azimuthal anisotropy in the middle and lower crust with the fast axes perpendicular to the rift axis. Also, we find substantial evidence of post rifting magmatic underplating in the lower crust, which could be reminiscence of Deccan volcanism and/or Reunion plume path.},

abstract = {The hyperbolic function proposed by Abbo–Sloan was employed not only to approach the Mohr–Coulomb criterion but also to express the plastic potential function. A better approximation to the Mohr–Coulomb yield and potential surfaces was achieved by increasing the transition angle and proven to be highly efficient in numerical convergence. When a Gaussian integral point goes into plastic state, two cases on yield stress adjustments were introduced. They may avoid solving the second derivative of the plastic potential function and the inverse matrix compared with the existing subroutine. Based on the above approaches, a fully implicit backward Euler integral regression algorithm was adopted. The two- and three-dimensional user subroutines which can consider the associated or non-associated flow rule were developed on the platform of the finite element program—ABAQUS. To verify the reliability of these two subroutines, firstly, the numerical simulations of the indoor conventional triaxial compression and uniaxial tensile tests were performed, and their results were compared with those of the embedded Mohr–Coulomb model and the analytical approach. Then the main influential factors including the associated or non-associated flow rule, the judgment criteria of slope failure, and the tensile strength of soil were analyzed, and the application of the two-dimensional subroutine in the stability analysis of a typical soil slope was discussed in detail through comparisons with the embedded model and the limit analysis method, which shows that this subroutine is more applicable and reliable than the latter two.},

abstract = {In many geotechnical problems, the presence of water and air in the voids of a soil skeleton has an influence on the behaviour of the soil. Effects such as time-dependent deformations, temporary reduction in the shear strength of the soil or even liquefaction of loosely layered sands can occur. To account for these effects in a geotechnical analysis, the soil has to be considered as a multiphase material with interaction between the single phases. A simple dynamic approach for the numerical modelling of a fully saturated soil with the finite element method using an explicit time integration rule is presented here. The governing equations describing the soil as a two-phase material are implemented within the framework of a user subroutine working as a constitutive model in the analysis. Simple problems considering different boundary conditions, static and dynamic loading conditions and non-linear material behaviour are investigated to verify the implemented approach. The results are compared with analytical solutions and with solutions obtained by the finite element method using an implicit equation solver. Compared with implicit integration methods, the approach presented has the advantage that - for dynamic analyses especially. An explicit integration method is often computationally more efficient for the analysis of large models with relatively short dynamic response times and for the analysis of extremely discontinuous processes such as dynamic pile driving.

abstract = {Any earthquake event is associated with a rupture mechanism at the source, propagation of seismic waves through underlying rock and finally these waves travel through the soil layers to the particular site of interest. The bedrock motion is significantly modified at the ground surface due to the presence of local soil layers above the bedrock beneath the site of interest. The estimation of the amplifications in ground response due to the local soil sites is a complex problem to the designers and the problem is more important for mega cities like Mumbai in India, where huge population may get affected due to devastations of earthquake. In the present study, the effect of local soil sites in modifying ground response is studied by performing one dimensional equivalent-linear ground response analysis for some of the typical Mumbai soil sites. Field borelog data of some typical sites in Mumbai city viz. Mangalwadi site, Walkeswar site, BJ Marg near Pandhari Chawl site are considered in this study. The ground responses are observed for range of input motions and the results are presented in terms of surface acceleration time history, ratio of shear stress to vertical effective stress versus time, acceleration response spectrum, Fourier amplitude ratio versus frequency etc. The typical amplifications of ground accelerations considering four strong ground motions with wide variation of low to high MHA, frequency contents and durations are obtained. Results show that MHA, bracketed duration, frequency content have significant effects on the amplification of seismic accelerations for typical 2001 Bhuj motion. The peak ground acceleration amplification factors are found to be about 2.50 for Mangalwadi site, 2.60 for Walkeswar site and 3.45 for BJ Marg site using 2001 Bhuj input motion. The response spectrum along various soil layers are obtained which will be useful for designers for earthquake resistant design of geotechnical structures in Mumbai for similar sites in the absence of site specific data. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {A multitude of observations suggest neotectonic deformation in and around India, but its causes and history are unknown. We use a 2 dimensional finite element model with heterogeneous elastic strengths in continental regions to model the regional stress field orientation and relative magnitudes since the Oligocene. The large-scale geological structure of India is embedded in our model by using published outlines of cratons, fold belts and basins, associated with estimates of their relative strengths, enabling the modelling of stress field deflections along interfaces between relatively strong and weak tectonic elements through time. At 33Ma a roughly NNW-SSE oriented band of relatively high maximum horizontal compressive stress (S{\textless}inf{\textgreater}Hmax{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) straddled India's west coast, while India's east coast and the adjacent Wharton Basin were characterized by relatively low intraplate stresses. Between 20Ma and the present growing collisional boundary forces combined with maturing mid-ocean ridge flanks result in the establishment of an arcuate belt with anomalously high intraplate stress that stretches from India to the Wharton Basin, intersecting the continental shelf roughly orthogonally and crossing the 85° East and Ninetyeast ridges. This results in a compressive tectonic regime favouring folding and inversion northeast of the Godavari Graben on India's east coast, as observed in seismic reflection data, whereas no tectonic reactivation is observed on the continental margin further north, closer to the Mahanadi Graben, or further south. Our stress models account for these differences via spatial variations in modelled horizontal stress magnitudes and intersection angles between margin-paralleling pre-existing basement structures and the evolving Neogene stress field. The models further account for fracture zone strike-slip reactivation offshore Sumatra and lithospheric folding along India's west and southeast coast and can be used to estimate the onset of these deformation episodes to at least the Oligocene and Miocene, respectively.},

This can be done by developing a sense for scanning the broad legal environment and being aware of legal issues in other parts of the education enterprise. Good professionals make a considerable effort to remain current in their career fields. Professional associations assist their members in this task by developing training and professional development programs that address the critical skills that professionals need to do their jobs. In higher education and student affairs, many practitioners acknowledge the importance of knowing how the law affects what they do. Constitutional law affects what kinds of rules and regulations public institutions promulgate. Contract law affects the type of business relationship administrators have with students and other constituents. Tort law affects how managers maintain facilities and supervise student events. As a result, professional associations have been created to focus attention solely on legal issues in higher education (e.g., Education Law Association and the Association for Interdisciplinary Initiatives in Higher Education Law and Policy), programs on a wide variety of legal topics appear on almost every national conference schedule, many professional associations devote part of their Web sites to law and legislation (e.g., American College Personnel Association, National Association of Student Personnel Administrators, and the Association for Student Judicial Affairs), and private companies publish newsletters designed to inform their readers about the latest court rulings (e.g., The College Student and the Courts by Gehring and Letzring, Synfax weekly report by Pavela). Some of these resources examine events that may be several years old since litigation takes time and initial decisions may be appealed. Many of the authors of these publications restate the facts of the particular case and give some guidance on appropriate administrative practice. These resources, however, may not always be able to identify what administrators might face on their own campuses in the near future or define decision-making processes that might help administrators avoid legal pitfalls. The purpose of this paper is to identify two important mechanisms that college administrators can use to more actively anticipate the legal issues that may occur on their own campuses. First, practitioners should scan the broad legal environment. Secondly, they should be aware of legal issues in other parts of the education enterprise. Anticipating},

abstract = {We developed an inversion method to estimate unbiased interseismic slip-deficit rates at plate interfaces from observed GPS velocity data with an elastic dislocation model. In this method, first, we subtract theoretical surface velocities due to known steady relative plate motion from the observedGPS data, and presume the residuals to be caused by slip deficit at plate interfaces. However, the observed GPS data always include rigid block translation and rotation, which cannot be explained by the elastic dislocation model.We treated the rigid block translation and rotation as systematic errors in the analysis, and removed them by transforming the velocity data into the average strain rates of triangle elements composed of adjacent GPS stations. By this transformation, original information about intrinsic deformation is preserved. Applying a unified Bayesian inversion formula to the GPS strain data, we can obtain unbiased slip-deficit rate distribution.We demonstrated the applicability of the method of GPS strain data inversion through the analysis of interseismic GPS velocity data (1996-2000) in the Kanto region, central Japan, where the North American (NAM), Pacific (PAC) and Philippine Sea (PHS) plates are interacting with each other in a complicated way. From this analysis we found a broad and high slip-deficit rate zone on the NAM-PHS plate interface, extending from southeast off the Boso peninsula to the Tokai region through the Izu-Mainland collision zone. Two high slip-deficit rate zones along the Sagami and Suruga troughs correspond to the source regions of the 1923 Kanto earthquake (M7.9) and a potential Tokai earthquake. On the PHS-PAC plate interface, though the estimation errors are large, we found a moderate slip-deficit rate zone far southeast off the Boso peninsula, where an M7.4 earthquake has occurred in 1953. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2013.

From the selected sites undisturbed as well as representative soil samples have been collected for detailed soil classification. The soil profiles from four sites have been considered for 1D and 2D ground response analysis by applying the free field motions of three Himalayan earthquakes namely Chamba earthquake (Mw-5.1), Chamoli earthquake (Mw-6.4) and Uttarkashi earthquake (Mw-6.5). An average value of Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) obtained from 1D and 2D analysis is considered for liquefaction analysis and post-liquefaction settlement.

@article{Mercier1980,
abstract = {Lithospheric stress magnitudes may be estimated through the application of geological thermobarometers [Mercier, 1980] and grain size piezometers [Ross et al., 1980]. Discontinuities in grain size profiles based on series of peridotite xenoliths from some representative localities can hardly correspond to abrupt changes in stress conditions at depth, inasmuch as no geochemical difference is observed across the textural discontinuities, and no phase changes are possible. These discontinuities would thus result from reaching a critical temperature or stress beyond which the dominant recrystallization mechanism drastically changes. Indeed, the grain size piezometer is very sensitive to the recrystallization mechanism [Poirier and Guillope, 1979], and whereas recrystallization through subgrain rotation has been recognized in some natural peridotites [e.g., Nicolas et al., 1971], the experimental data available so far apply to grain boundary migration recrystallization. On the basis of two significantly different grain size profile discontinuities, an empirical relationship ($\sigma$ = 74.5/D) is inferred for the grain size resulting from subgrain rotation. Applying this new relationship when relevant, the stress magnitudes estimated from deep samples remain virtually unchanged relative to previous results [Ave Lallemant et al., 1980], as do their implications regarding large-scale convection. However, revised magnitudes for the uppermost mantle may be significantly increased to a value as high as 45 MPa (450 bar) for the Basin and Range Province, with stresses in the lower crust possibly reaching up to 80 MPa.},

abstract = {Properties of soils and the techniques to determine the same are very much dependent on the local geological conditions and the environment. The scope of the present study includes understanding the model predictions from classical constitutive models such as Mohr-Coulomb {\&} Drucker-Prager. These models are widely used despite availability of advanced models vowing to simplicity and easily determinable model parameters. An attempt has been made to present the formulation of the stress integration procedure for Mohr-Coulomb and Drucker-Prager models with associative yielding condition by using the incremental plastic theory which is a conventional and convenient practice in drawing stress paths. Stress dependent moduli are used for the purpose. To check the applicability of these models, experimental values from published data are compared with the model predictions. The parameters involved are same as Cam clay model parameters which are simple and easily determinable from the experimental results performed in routine soil investigations. By making the comparative study, the salient features that can be captured are understood for appropriate use in engineering applications. The undrained situation which is realistic in clayey soils is used in the present work. It is observed that the Mohr- Coulomb Model shows lower predictions compared to Drucker-Prager Model. These are the deviations observed with the stress-strain response of the results, in that the strength predictions being similar, the elasto-plastic response {\&} the critical state conditions are different.},

In such models metamorphic density changes take place without volumetric effects. We assess the impact of the Boussinesq approximation by comparing models of orogeny accompanied by lower crustal eclogitization both with and without the approximation. Our results demonstrate that the approximation may cause errors approaching 100 per cent in characteristic measures of orogenic shape. Mass conservation errors in Boussinesq models amplify with model time. Mass conservative models of metamorphism are therefore essential to understand long-term tectonic evolution and to assess the importance of the different geodynamic processes.},

abstract = {[1] Dislocation models can simulate static deformation caused by slip along a fault. These models usually take the form of a dislocation embedded in a homogeneous, isotropic, Poisson-solid half-space (HIPSHS). However, the widely accepted HIPSHS assumptions poorly approximate subduction zone systems of converging oceanic and continental crust. This study uses three-dimensional finite element models (FEMs) that allow for any combination ( including none) of the HIPSHS assumptions to compute synthetic Green's functions for displacement. Using the 1995 M-w = 8.0 Jalisco-Colima, Mexico, subduction zone earthquake and associated measurements from a nearby GPS array as an example, FEM-generated synthetic Green's functions are combined with standard linear inverse methods to estimate dislocation distributions along the subduction interface. Loading a forward HIPSHS model with dislocation distributions, estimated from FEMs that sequentially relax the HIPSHS assumptions, yields the sensitivity of predicted displacements to each of the HIPSHS assumptions. For the subduction zone models tested and the specific field situation considered, sensitivities to the individual Poisson-solid, isotropy, and homogeneity assumptions can be substantially greater than GPS measurement uncertainties. Forward modeling quantifies stress coupling between the M-w = 8.0 earthquake and a nearby M-w = 6.3 earthquake that occurred 63 days later. Coulomb stress changes predicted from static HIPSHS models cannot account for the 63-day lag time between events. Alternatively, an FEM that includes a poroelastic oceanic crust, which allows for postseismic pore fluid pressure recovery, can account for the lag time. The pore fluid pressure recovery rate puts an upper limit of 10(-17) m(2) on the bulk permeability of the oceanic crust.},

abstract = {Fault intersections are a geometric complexity that frequently occurs in nature. Here we focus on earthquake rupture behavior when a continuous planar main fault has a second fault branching off of it. We use the finite element (FE) method to examine which faults are activated and how the surrounding material responds for both elastic and elastic-plastic off-fault descriptions. Compared to an elastic model, a noncohesive elastic-plastic material, intended to account for zones of damaged rock bordering maturely slipped faults, will inhibit rupture on compressional side branches and promote rupture of extensional side branches. Activation of extensional side branches can be delayed and is triggered by continued rupture propagation on the main fault. We examine the deformation near the branching junction and find that fault opening is common for elastic materials, especially for compressional side branches. An elastic-plastic material is more realistic because elevated stresses around the propagating rupture tip and at the branching junction should bring the surrounding material to failure. With an elastic-plastic material model, fault opening is inhibited for a range of realistic material parameters. For large cohesive strengths, opening can occur, but with material softening, a real feature of plastically deforming rocks, opening can be prevented. We also discuss algorithmic artifacts that may arise due to the presence of such a triple junction. When opening does not occur, the behavior at the triple junction is simplified and standard contact routines in FE programs are able to properly represent the physical situation.},

abstract = {In the Sub-Himalayan zone, the frontal Siwalik range abuts against the alluvial plain with an abrupt physiographic break along the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT), defining the present-day tectonic boundary between the Indian plate and the Himalayan orogenic prism. The frontal Siwalik range is characterized by large active anticline structures, which were developed as fault propagation and fault-bend folds in the hanging wall of the HFT. Fault scarps showing surface ruptures and offsets observed in excavated trenches indicate that the HFT is active. South of the HFT, the piedmont zone shows incipient growth of structures, drainage modification, and 2-3 geomorphic depositional surfaces. In the hinterland between the HFT and the MBT, reactivation and out-of-sequence faulting displace Late Quaternary-Holocene sediments. Geodetic measurements across the Himalaya indicate a {\~{}}100-km-wide zone, underlain by the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT), between the HFT and the main microseismicity belt to north is locked. The bulk of shortening, 15-20 mm/year, is consumed aseismically at mid-crustal depth through ductile by creep. Assuming the wedge model, reactivation of the hinterland faults may represent deformation prior to wedge attaining critical taper. The earthquake surface ruptures, ≥240 km in length, interpreted on the Himalayan mountain front through paleoseismology imply reactivation of the HFT and may suggest foreland propagation of the thrust belt. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Global plate motion models provide a spatial and temporal framework for geological data and have been effective tools for exploring processes occurring at the earth's surface. However, published models either have insufficient temporal coverage or fail to treat tectonic plates in a self-consistent manner. They usually consider the motions of selected features attached to tectonic plates, such as continents, but generally do not explicitly account for the continuous evolution of plate boundaries through time. In order to explore the coupling between the surface and mantle, plate models are required that extend over at least a few hundred million years and treat plates as dynamic features with dynamically evolving plate boundaries. We have constructed a new type of global plate motion model consisting of a set of continuously-closing topological plate polygons with associated plate boundaries and plate velocities since the break-up of the supercontinent Pangea. Our model is underpinned by plate motions derived from reconstructing the seafloor-spreading history of the ocean basins and motions of the continents and utilizes a hybrid absolute reference frame, based on a moving hotspot model for the last 100. Ma, and a true-polar wander corrected paleomagnetic model for 200 to 100. Ma. Detailed regional geological and geophysical observations constrain plate boundary inception or cessation, and time-dependent geometry. Although our plate model is primarily designed as a reference model for a new generation of geodynamic studies by providing the surface boundary conditions for the deep earth, it is also useful for studies in disparate fields when a framework is needed for analyzing and interpreting spatio-temporal data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

It is the first book to cover a wide variety of flows, including single-phase, two-phase, black oil, volatile, compositional, nonisothermal, and chemical compositional flows in both ordinary porous and fractured porous media. In addition, a range of computational methods are used, and benchmark problems of nine comparative solution projects organized by the Society of Petroleum Engineers are presented for the first time in book form. The book reviews multiphase flow equations and computational methods to introduce basic terminologies and notation. A thorough discussion of practical aspects of the subjects is presented in a consistent manner, and the level of treatment is rigorous without being unnecessarily abstract. Audience: this book can be used as a textbook for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in geology, petroleum engineering, and applied mathematics; as a reference book for professionals in these fields, as well as scientists working in the area of petroleum reservoir simulation; as a handbook for employees in the oil industry who need a basic understanding of modeling and computational method concepts; and by researchers in hydrology, environmental remediation, and some areas of biological tissue modeling. Calculus, physics, and some acquaintance with partial differential equations and simple matrix algebra are necessary prerequisites.},

abstract = {Here it is documented how an existing code for modelling mantle convection in a cartesian domain, Stag3D, has been converted to model a 3D spherical shell by using the recently introduced yin-yang grid. StagYY is thus the latest evolution of a code that has been in continuous use and development for about 15 years so incorporates much physics and several features including compressibility, phase transitions, compositional variations, non-linear rheology, parallelisation, tracers to track composition, partial melting and melt migration, and the ability to also model spherical patches, cartesian boxes, and various 2D geometries by changing one input switch. StagYY uses a multigrid solver to obtain a velocity-pressure solution at each timestep on a staggered grid, a finite-volume scheme for advection of temperature and tracers to track composition. Convergence of multigrid solvers in the presence of realistically large viscosity variations has always been a problem; here a new pressure interpolation scheme is presented that can dramatically improve the robustness of the iterations to large viscosity variations, with up to 19 orders of magnitude variation in presented tests. Benchmark tests show that StagYY produces results that are consistent with those produced by other codes. Performance tests show reasonable scaling on a parallel Beowulf cluster up to 64 CPUs, with up to 1.2 billion unknowns solved for in a few minutes. StagYY is designed to be a stand-alone application with no libraries required and if MPI is installed it can be run in parallel. Technical issues and goals for the future are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In July 2019, a series of seismic events, including a magnitude (Mw) 7.1 mainshock and Mw 6.4 foreshock, occurred in Eastern California. Studying these seismic events can significantly improve our understanding of the Eastern California tectonic environment. Sentinel-1A and ALOS-2 PALSAR images were utilized to obtain co-seismic deformation fields, including mainshock and foreshock deformation. The Okada elastic dislocation model and ascending and descending orbit results were used to invert the co-seismic slip distribution and obtain a co-seismic focal mechanism solution. Using ascending Sentinel-1A images, a time-series deformation was obtained for 402 d after the earthquake, and the deformation evolution mechanism was analyzed. The maximum uplift caused by the co-seismic mechanism reached 1.5 m in the line of sight (LOS), and the maximum subsidence reached 1 m in the LOS. For 402 d after the earthquake, the area remained active, and its deformation was dominated by after-slip. The co-seismic inversion results illustrated that California earthquakes were mainly strike-slip. The co-seismic inversion magnitude was approximately Mw 7.08. The Coulomb stress change illustrated that the seismic moment caused by the co-seismic slip was 4.24 × 1026 N × m, which is approximately Mw 7.06. This finding is consistent with the co-seismic slip distribution inversion results.},

In most diagrams used for interpreting compositional data, the basic statistical assumption of open space for all variables is violated. Among these graphic tools, discrimination diagrams have been in use for nearly 40 years to decipher tectonic setting. The newer set of five tectonomagmatic discrimination diagrams published in 2006 (based on major-elements) and two sets made available in 2008 and 2011 (both based on immobile elements) fulfill all statistical requirements for correct handling of compositional data, including the multivariate nature of compositional variables, representative sampling, and probability-based tectonic field boundaries. Additionally in the most recent proposal of 2011, samples having normally distributed, discordantoutlier free, log-ratio variables were used in linear discriminant analysis. In these three sets of five diagrams each, discrimination was successfully documented for four tectonic settings (island arc, continental rift, ocean-island, and midocean ridge). The discrimination diagrams have been extensively evaluated for their performance by different workers. We exemplify these two sets of new diagrams (one set based on major-elements and the other on immobile elements)using ophiolites from Boso Peninsula, Japan. This example is included forillustration purposes only and is not meant for testing of these newer diagrams.Their evaluation and comparison with older, conventional bivariate or ternarydiagrams have been reported in other papers.},

The discrepancy is best explained if the Australian plate contains two component plates. Thus, the traditionally defined Indo- Australian plate consists of three component plates and multiple diffuse plate boundaries.

A survey was carried out in 1997 to 1998 in Veneto region (Italy) where a serious outbreak of FD was in progress. Phytoplasma identification by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses on 275 grapevine samples and on batches of Scaphoideus titanus was carried out. RFLP analyses of the 16S rDNA/spacer region with TaqI detected the presence of two distinct elm yellows phytoplasma subgroups designated 16SrV-C and 16SrV-D in 77 FD-infected grapevine samples. Only phytoplasmas of the 16SrV-D subgroup were detected in S. titanus. In 1997, the two phytoplasma subgroups appeared to be located in two diverse geographic areas; but in 1998, the 16SrV-D type also was detected in the provinces where in 1997 only 16SrV-C type was identified. The sequencing of a 400-bp fragment at the 3' end of 16S rDNA plus spacer region allowed a specific primer construction that was successfully employed for detection of both FD types in grapevine by direct PCR.},

abstract = {The current zoning maps in the Indian seismic code are prepared based on earthquake information available up to 1993 and has not been updated since 2002. It is considered that the hazard zoning needs to be re-examined and that the boundaries of zoning areas revised. The code design peak ground acceleration (PGA) for the Maximum Considered Earthquake (MCE) is 0.36 g and the Design Basis Earthquake (DBE) is 0.18 g for service life of structure, for the highest area, Zone V. However, some Indian regions are located in the high seismicity areas of the active Himalayan plate boundary but are indicated to be Zone IV which has an MCE of 0.24 g. These Himalayan regions have experienced several instances of severe to moderate ground shaking and building damage within last 100 years. Consequently it is feared that the design PGA of the Indian code for DBE event is too optimistic and may underestimate the seismic loading in such a high seismicity region. A preliminary site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) has been carried out to review the potential risk of seismic source zones and the latest earthquake information. The PSHA method combines the knowledge of seismic source zones and their associated earthquake recurrence with appropriate attenuation relationships to produce hazard curves in terms of level of ground motion and an associated annual probability of being exceeded. Design response spectra have been calculated for sites in the Himalayan region and for other major cities in India. The results are compared to those implied by the current Indian seismic code and those from the recent study carried out by the Indian National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).},

The loading of the aircraft has been assigned through the corresponding reaction-time response curve. ABAQUS/Explicit finite element code has been used to carry out the three-dimensional numerical simulations. The concrete damaged plasticity model was used to simulate the behavior of concrete while the behavior of steel reinforcement was incorporated using the Johnson-Cook elasto-viscoplastic material model. The mid-height of containment has been found to experience most severe deformation against each aircraft. Phantom F4 has been found to be most disastrous at each location.

abstract = {With reference to practical engineering problems it is shown that considerable differences may be encountered between the results from associated and those from non-associated plasticity theories. Next, the need for a non-associated plasticity theory is demonstrated by considering test results for sand, concrete and rock. Elementary material parameters are discussed such as Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio for the description of the elastic properties; and a cohesion and a friction angle for the determination of the strength. The salient difference from associated plasticity theory concerns the introduction of a dilatancy angle which controls the inelastic (plastic) volume changes. This dilatancy angle is not only a suitable parameter for the description of soils, but also appears to be useful for concrete and rock. Basically, the paper consists of three parts as the authors consider three types of models of increasing complexity. The first model is a perfectly-plastic model, which employs the five aforementioned parameters. It is based on test data. The second model is a straightforward extension of the first model by augmenting it with friction hardening and cohesion softening. This novel idea is introduced to account for the degradation of the cohesion of cemented granular materials with increasing inelastic deformation. The model is employed in an analysis which shows that plastic deformations tend to localize in thin shear bands. Finally, a review is given of concepts for modelling hysteresis and strain accumulation in cyclic loading. Refs.},

abstract = {A continuous kinematic model of present-day plate motions is developed which (1) provides more realistic models of plate shapes than employed in the original work of Bercovici {\&} Wessel (1994), and (2) provides a means whereby geophysical data on intraplate deformation is used to estimate plate-margin widths for all plates. A given plate's shape function (which is unity within the plate and zero outside the plate) can be represented by analytic functions as long as the distance from a point inside the plate to the plate's boundary can be expressed as a single-valued function of azimuth (i.e. a single-valued polar function). To allow sufficient realism to the plate boundaries, without the excessive smoothing used by Bercovici {\&} Wessel, the plates are divided along pseudo-boundaries; the boundaries of plate sections are then simple enough to be modelled as single-valued polar functions. Moreover, the pseudo-boundaries have little or no effect on the final results. The plate shape function for each plate also includes a plate-margin function which can be constrained by geophysical data on intraplate deformation. We demonstrate how this margin function can be determined by using, as an example data set, the global seismicity distribution for shallow (depths less than 29 km) earthquakes of magnitude greater than 4. Robust estimation techniques are used to determine the width of seismicity distributions along plate boundaries; these widths are then turned into plate-margin functions, that is analytic functions of the azimuthal polar coordinate (the same azimuth of which the distance to the plate boundary is a single-valued function). The model is used to investigate the effects of 'realistic' finite-margin widths on the Earth's present-day vorticity (i.e. strike-slip shear) and divergence fields as well as the kinetic energies of the toroidal (strike-slip and spin) and poloidal (divergent and convergent) flow fields. The divergence and vorticity fields are far more well defined than for the standard discontinuous plate model and distinctly show the influence of diffuse plate boundaries such as the northeast boundary of the Eurasian plate. The toroidal and poloidal kinetic energies of this model differ only slightly from those of the standard plate model; the differences, however, are systematic and indicate a greater proportion of spin kinetic energy in the continuous plate model.},

abstract = {[1] We investigate the rupture process of the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan, earthquake using extensive near-source observations, including three-component velocity waveforms at 36 strong motion stations and 119 GPS measurements. A three-plane fault geometry derived from our previous inversion using only static data [Ji et al., 2001] is applied. The slip amplitude, rake angle, rupture initiation time, and risetime function are inverted simultaneously with a recently developed finite fault inverse method that combines a wavelet transform approach with a simulated annealing algorithm [Ji et al., 2002b]. The inversion results are validated by the forward prediction of an independent data set, the teleseismic P and SH ground velocities, with notable agreement. The results show that the total seismic moment release of this earthquake is 2.7 X 10(20) N m and that most of the slip occurred in a triangular-shaped asperity involving two fault segments, which is consistent with our previous static inversion. The rupture front propagates with an average rupture velocity of similar to2.0 km s(-1), and the average slip duration (risetime) is 7.2 s. Several interesting observations related to the temporal evolution of the Chi-Chi earthquake are also investigated, including (1) the strong effect of the sinuous fault plane of the Chelungpu fault on spatial and temporal variations in slip history, (2) the intersection of fault 1 and fault 2 not being a strong impediment to the rupture propagation, and (3) the observation that the peak slip velocity near the surface is, in general, higher than on the deeper portion of the fault plane, as predicted by dynamic modeling.},

abstract = {Present-day deformation and seismicity of continental lithosphere are characterized by a first-order dichotomy between Plate Boundary Zones (PBZ) and Stable Continental Regions (SCR). Whereas the former are associated with high strain and seismicity rates, the latter tend to remain un-deformed, except in localized regions of higher strain and seismicity, commonly related to fossilized paleo-PBZ acting as locally weaker domains. Because of their low amplitudes, these intraplate strain and seismicity rates are particularly difficult to measure and characterize. In this study, we propose a simple model to explain and quantify first-order continental strain rate variations, focusing on intraplate regions. Assuming near-failure equilibrium on 1D lithosphere profiles, we derive steady-state strain rates driven by tectonic forces as a function of rheological models that include new strain-weakening rheologies in order to simulate tectonic inheritance. Within this framework, inherited strain-weakening plays a fundamental role in allowing for and explaining strain and seismicity concentration in intraplate weak zones: our model predicts strain rates in intraplate weak zones up to two to three orders of magnitude higher compared to stable cratons due to the effect of tectonic inheritance on rheology weakening. These model predictions are in agreement with empirical estimations in intraplate regions and can provide a conceptual framework for characterization of SCR strain and seismicity rates.},

@article{Hashimoto2014,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2013, Springer Basel. The generation of interplate earthquakes can be regarded as a process of tectonic stress accumulation and release, driven by relative plate motion. We completed a physics-based simulation system for earthquake generation cycles at plate interfaces in the Japan region, where the Pacific plate is descending beneath the North American and Philippine Sea plates, and the Philippine Sea plate is descending beneath the North American and Eurasian plates. The system is composed of a quasi-static tectonic loading model and a dynamic rupture propagation model, developed on a realistic 3-D plate interface model. The driving force of the system is relative plate motion. In the quasi-static tectonic loading model, mechanical interaction at plate interfaces is rationally represented by the increase of tangential displacement discontinuity (fault slip) across them on the basis of dislocation theory for an elastic surface layer overlying Maxwell-type viscoelastic half-space. In the dynamic rupture propagation model, stress changes due to fault slip motion on non-planar plate interfaces are evaluated with the boundary integral equation method. The progress of seismic (dynamic) or aseismic (quasi-static) fault slip on plate interfaces is governed by a slip- and time-dependent fault constitutive law. As an example, we numerically simulated earthquake generation cycles at the source region of the 1968 Tokachi-oki earthquake on the North American-Pacific plate interface. From the numerical simulation, we can see that postseismic stress relaxation in the asthenosphere accelerates stress accumulation in the source region. When the stress state of the source region is close to a critical level, dynamic rupture is rapidly accelerated and develops over the whole source region. When the stress state is much lower than the critical level, the rupture is not accelerated. This means that the stress state realized by interseismic tectonic loading essentially controls the subsequent dynamic rupture process.},

Overall, results obtained in small-scale laboratory experiments provide robust constraints on deformation mechanisms and viscosities at the natural laboratory conditions. Geodetic inferences of the viscous strength of the upper mantle are consistent with flow of mantle rocks at temperatures and water contents determined from surface heat-flow, seismic, and mantle xenolith studies. Laboratory results show that deformation mechanisms and rheology strongly vary as a function of stress, grain size, and fluids. Field studies reveal a strong tendency for deformation in the lower crust and uppermost mantle in and adjacent to fault zones to localize into systems of discrete shear zones with strongly reduced grain size and strength. Deformation mechanisms and rheology may vary over short spatial (shear zone) and temporal (earthquake cycle) scales.},

abstract = {The squeezing of rock tunnels in soft strata is often encountered during and after excavation, which is closely related to the viscoplasticity of rock mass. However, previous studies involved multiple creep elements in the calculation of visco-plastic deformation, which cost much time to identify creep parameters. In this paper, a novel four-element fractional visco-plastic (FVP) model, which includes two Abel dashpots, one spring and one visco-plastic body, is established using fractional derivatives. Three-dimensional creep equation of the FVP model is first derived using the von Mises equivalent plastic stress-strain relationship. Then the closed-form solution of visco-plastic deformation of the surrounding rock around circular tunnels is derived by the FVP model combining with the non-associated flow rule and the Hoek-Brown criterion. Next, taking rock tunnels that are excavated in three different quality rock salt as examples, parametric investigations of time-dependent parameters and time-independent parameters are carried out. Visco-plastic deformation curves of rock tunnels, which includes (a) the displacement of tunnel wall versus time; (b) the displacement of visco-plastic zone versus depth, are analyzed. Finally, the auxiliary tunnel of Jinping II hydropower station is taken as a typical example for studying the time-dependent deformation of rock tunnels. The analytical results are in good agreement with the experimental and monitoring data. This paper may blaze a new trail to quickly evaluate the visco-plastic deformation of rock tunnels during the early design process.},

abstract = {Many materials in modern civil engineering applications, such as interlayers for laminated safety glass, are polymer-based. These materials are showing distinct viscoelastic (strain-rate) and temperature dependent behaviour. In literature, different mathematical representations of these phenomena exist. A common one is the ‘Prony-series' representation, which is implemented in many state-of-the-art Finite-Element-Analysis-Software to incorporate linear viscoelastic material behaviour. The Prony-parameters at a certain reference temperature can either be determined by relaxation or retardation experiments in the time domain or with a steady state oscillation in the frequency domain in the so called ‘Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis' followed by a ‘Time–Temperature-Superposition-Principle'. However, present research shows that polymeric materials also may need to have constitutive equations which include hyperelasticity (nonlinear stress–strain behaviour in a quasi-static condition) when undergoing large deformations, so that the material model should be expanded for a more realistic representation in numerical simulations. A novel method for the whole identification process for a numerical material model in terms of a linear Generalized Maxwell Model (Prony-series) based on experimental data will be presented. Furthermore, material parameters for different hyperelastic material models based on experimental investigations will be shown and compared. Future research activities as well as extensions of the presented novel method are also highlighted within this paper.},

abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is regarded as a promising strategy for mitigating global warming. A 19{\%} CCS contribution to CO2 reduction by 2050, as envisaged by the International Energy Agency, would require the construction of thousands of CCS sites by the 2030s and beyond. CO2 storage may need to last for tens of thousands of years to avoid potential global warming and major Earth system changes, and a critical site selection criterion will be the likelihood of future escape of stored CO2 due to fault reactivation. However, future long-term intraplate stress field changes have not been considered in this context. Here we focus on Australia, where 61 potential CCS sites have been proposed, and model the evolving intraplate stress field due to the future growth of tectonic collisional forces north of Australia. Counter intuitively, the largest changes are predicted for some parts of western, central and southeast Australia, all regions far away from plate boundaries, reflecting the non-linear interaction of plate boundary forces with a geologically heterogeneous continent. We suggest that at least ten suggested CCS sites are located in regions where major changes of in situ stress regimes can be expected in the next 100,000 years, requiring a careful evaluation of potential future fault reactivation and a breach of reservoir seals. Our results highlight the importance of considering future intraplate stress field changes for selecting CCS sites, particularly within continental regions affected by ongoing mountain building processes including Australia, India, South America, Asia and southern Europe.},

abstract = {In this study, the cluster analysis (CA), probabilistic methods, and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to predict landslide susceptibility. The Geographic Information System (GIS) is used as the basic tool for spatial data management. CA is applied to select non-landslide dataset for later analysis. A probabilistic method is suggested to calculate the rating of the relative importance of each class belonging to each conditional factor. ANN is applied to calculate the weight (i.e., relative importance) of each factor. Using the ratings and the weights, it is proposed to calculate the landslide susceptibility index (LSI) for each pixel in the study area. The obtained LSI values can then be used to construct the landslide susceptibility map. The aforementioned proposed method was applied to the Longfeng town, a landslide-prone area in Hubei province, China. The following eight conditional factors were selected: lithology, slope angle, distance to stream/reservoir, distance to road, stream power index (SPI), altitude, curvature, and slope aspect. To assess the conditional factor effects, the weights were calculated for four cases, using 8 factors, 6 factors, 5 factors, and 4 factors, respectively. Then, the results of the landslide susceptibility analysis for these four cases, with and without weighting, were obtained. To validate the process, the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were applied. In addition, the results were compared with the existing landslide locations. The validation results showed good agreement between the existing landslides and the computed susceptibility maps. The results with weighting were found to be better than that without weighting. The best accuracy was obtained for the case with 5 conditional factors with weighting.},

abstract = {When information about density ($\rho$) is unavailable, it is often estimated from P- wave velocity (Vp) using an empirical relationship such as Gardner's equation. Since access to S-wave velocity is increasing, it is reasonable to consider whether Vs might contribute to improving density estimates. Sandstone and limestone datasets taken from the literature demonstrate correlations between Vp and Vs, Vp and $\rho$, and Vs and p. Both sandstone and limestone show strong correlations between Vp and Vs. The correlations between velocity and density are strong for the limestone data, but are scattered for the sandstone data. The sandstone velocity-density correlations improve significantly when the data are categorized by clay content. When measured densities are compared to densities calculated from Gardner's empirical relation, there is a systematic error in both datasets. The error increases as density decreases. Some of the factors which might affect the uncertainty in the density estimates are porosity, clay content, and lithology. Since Vs is also dependent on these factors, we are seeking empirical relationships among Vp, Vs, and p. One goal of this investigation is to estimate density from seismically available measurements.},

Several interesting observations and inferences are made through analysis of the receiver functions such as (a) a very thick crust ({\textgreater}40 km) with oppositely dipping Moho beneath the EGMB and Archean Bastar Craton, (b) EGMB formed from amalgamation of different crustal domains thrust over one another possibly during the Pan-African orogeny, (c) the Archean Bastar Craton crust extends (∼75 km) eastward beneath the EGMB, from its surficial geological boundary, (d) there is a sharp contrast in the crustal structure (with ∼20 km Moho offset) at the contact between the Rengali Province and Singhbhum Craton which does not support southward growth of the Singhbhum Craton through accretion, (e) anorthosite complexes may possibly be created by rising diapirs channeled through the weak zones in the crust, from the magma chambers developed by melting of frontal portion of the underthrusting lower crust. We report a significant change in the crustal architecture just east of the most elevated topography observed along the profile covering the Bastar Craton and the EGMB. It requires further careful petrological investigations to ascertain the relationship of high elevation and its linkages with the deep crust, forming a separate domain. Our results do not support or discard a Grenvillian age (∼1 Ga) docking of the EGMB with Proto-India, though it is preferred to explain the present day crustal features with intense Pan-African (0.5–0.6 Ga) reorganization.},

This deficiency of driving forces can be overcome by obduction of an actively overriding plate, which forces the young plate either to subduct or to collide. This mechanism leads to shallow flattening of the slab as observed today under parts of the west coast of North and South America. Here this process is examined by means of numerical modeling. The convergence velocity between oceanic and continental lithospheric plates is computed from the modeling results, and the ratio of the subduction velocity over the overriding velocity is used as a diagnostic of the efficiency of the ongoing subduction process. We have investigated several factors influencing the mechanical resistance working against the subduction process. In particular, we have studied the effect of a preexisting lithospheric fault with a depth dependent shear resistance, partly decoupling the oceanic lithosphere from the overriding continent. We also investigated the lubricating effect of a 7 km thick basaltic crustal layer on the efficiency of the subduction process and found a log-linear relation between convergence rate and viscosity prefactor characterizing the strength of the oceanic crust, for a range of parameter values including values for basaltic rocks, derived from empirical data. A strong mantle fixes the subducting slab while being overridden and prevents the slab from further subduction in a Benioff style. Viscous heating lowers the coupling strength of the crustal interface between the converging plates with about half an order of magnitude and therefore contributes significantly to the subduction process. Finally, when varying the overriding velocity from 2.5 to 10 cm yr-1, we found a non-linear increase of the subduction velocity due to the presence of non-linear mantle rheology. These results indicate that active obduction of oceanic lithosphere by an overriding continental lithosphere is a viable mechanism for shallow flat subduction over a wide range of model parameters.

abstract = {Crustal deformation computation using 3-D high-fidelity models has been in heavy demand due to accumulation of observational data. This approach is computationally expensive and more than 105 repetitive computations are required for various application including Monte Carlo simulation, stochastic inverse analysis, and optimization. To handle the massive computation cost, we develop a fast Finite Element (FE) analysis method using multi-GPUs for crustal deformation. We use algorithms appropriate for GPUs and accelerate calculations such as sparse matrix-vector product. By reducing the computation time, we are able to conduct multiple crustal deformation computations in a feasible timeframe. As an application example, we conduct stochastic inverse analysis considering uncertainties in geometry and estimate coseismic slip distribution in the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, by performing 360,000 crustal deformation computations for different 8 × 107 DOF FE models using the proposed method.},

Local deformation patterns observed in many of the numerous intraplate Tertiary basins and their borders, such as the Madrid Basin and the Sierra de Altomira, are at first sight incompatible with the regional stress field under which they were formed. We demonstrate, however, that they can be explained as the effect of several stress fields that acted on the Iberian Peninsula from earliest Tertiary onward. Data on local deformation can constrain both magnitudes and directions of forces acting on the plate boundaries of Iberia, enabling us to estimate the relative importance of the different plate driving and deforming mechanisms providing further constraints on the tectonic evolution of Iberia.},

abstract = {The presence of large earthquakes, east-west-striking folds and thrust faults in sediments, and east-west-striking undulations of wavelength 200 km in topography and gravity shows that the equatorial Indian Ocean is the locus of unusual deformation. This deformation has been interpreted as a diffuse boundary between two tectonic plates. Seismic stratigraphy and deep-sea drilling at two locations in the Bengal fan indicate that the deformation began 7.5-8.0 Myr ago. Here, however, we show, using plate reconstructions, that motion across this diffuse oceanic plate boundary began more than 10 Myr earlier than previously inferred and that the amount of north-south convergence across the boundary through the central Indian basin has been significantly greater than the convergence estimated from seismic profiles. The relative plate velocity accommodated across the central Indian basin has varied with tie and has been as fast as {\~{}}6 mm yr-1-about half the separation rate of Earth's slowest-spreading mid-ocean ridge. The earliest interval of measurable motion, which began more than 18 Myr ago, may coincide with rapid denudation of the Tibetan plateau from {\~{}}21 Myr to 15-17 Myr (ref. 16). The present motion across the central Indian Basin began no earlier than 11 Myr-following an earlier interval of slower motion from 18 to 11 Myr-and may have begun at {\~{}}8 Myr, when the Tibetan plateau is thought to have attained its maximum elevation.},

abstract = {The Piedmont Zone is the least studied part of the Ganga Plain. The northern limit of the Piedmont Zone is defined by the Himalayan Frontal Thrust (HFT) along which the Himalaya is being thrust over the alluvium of the Ganga Plain. Interpretation of satellite imagery, Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) and field data has helped in the identification and mapping of various morphotectonic features in the densely forested and cultivated Piedmont Zone in the Kumaun region of the Uttarakhand state of India. The Piedmont Zone has formed as a result of coalescing alluvial fans, alluvial aprons and talus deposits. The fans have differential morphologies and aggradation processes within a common climatic zone and similar litho-tectonic setting of the catchment area. Morphotectonic analysis reveals that the fan morphologies and aggradation processes in the area are mainly controlled by the ongoing tectonic activities. Such activities along the HFT and transverse faults have controlled the accommodation space by causing differential subsidence of the basin, and aggradation processes by causing channel migration, channel incision and shifting of depocentres. The active tectonic movements have further modified the landscape of the area in the form of tilted alluvial fan, gravel ridges, terraces and uplifted gravels. {\textcopyright} Printed in India.},

abstract = {Seismic wide-angle record sections from favorably placed source and limited-aperture recording spreads, particularly across collision boundaries, reveal bright unusual high-velocity contrast reflections of limited lateral coherence. The arrival times of the unusual reflections for recording updip of the reflecting plane align as high apparent velocity phases at wide-angle offsets. Coincident near-offset reflection images from similar structural features provide additional control for modeling the unusual phases on the wide-angle record sections. We propose an approach for joint interpretation of these coincident seismic data sets and modeling the unusual phases on the processed wide-angle records to delineate both the velocity stratification and the geometry of the deep crustal structures consistent with the near-offset reflection images. Processed and migrated near-offset reflection images reveal several steeply dipping isolated reflections on the western margin of the south Delhi Fold Belt (DFB), NW India, interpreted as the south Delhi thrust fault. Coincident limited-aperture, wide-angle records reveal bright unusual reflections, which are also found to be associated with the same thrust fault. Observations of similar dipping reflection patterns in various other regions lend support to consider them as genuine in-plane reflections resulting from a structural fabric imprinted on horizontally oriented geological structures. We use the reflectivity structural model from the near-offset data set that provides necessary constraints for modeling and simulating the travel times and amplitudes of the unusual reflections recognized in the wide-angle records. The unusual reflections are effectively used as part of the wide-angle data set for Gaussian beam synthetic seismogram modeling, thus delineating for the first time a complex 2-D model of the seismic velocity structure of the deep crust and uppermost mantle across the Marwar Basin (MB) and the DFB. The dipping events revealed in the wide-angle data set are successfully modeled and interpreted as reflections from the thrust fault, consistent with the near-offset reflection image. The 2-D velocity model, parameterized as a stack of isolated dipping reflectors embedded in deep crustal layers, is successively refined by including the structural features recognizable both in the near-offset reflection image and in the wide-angle records. The unusual reflections are modeled as a set of discrete reflectors representing local velocity variations imprinted on the background of a deep crustal velocity structure. The lamellar structure revealed by short, isolated dipping and the subhorizontal middle to lower crustal reflections suggests heterogeneities at scale lengths on the order of at least the Fresnel zone diameter as resolved here. The local velocity variations in the deep crust can be considered analogous, on a different scale, to the models in which velocity heterogeneities on scale lengths of the seismic wavelength constitute a medium of random distribution of scatterers. The crustal-scale south Delhi thrust fault on the western margin of the DFB, delineated as the stack of reflectors dipping 25°-30°SE, probably developed during the Mesoproterozoic collisional episode related to the Delhi orogeny, contemporaneous with the formation of Rodinia. It is concluded that complex structural features developed during collisional episodes can survive through geological periods, longer than generally expected, depending on the accretionary characteristics at the time of orogenic evolution. The 2-D velocity model further reveals significant variations of crustal seismic structure, with a relatively sharp and shallow Moho (at 39-40 km) in the MB and a deeper Moho (at 45-47 km) underlying a 12 km thick subhorizontal lamella of high-velocity (6.9-7.5 km/s) layers in the DFB regions.

abstract = {Central India is traversed by a WSW-ENE trending Narmada-Son lineament (NSL) which is characterized by the presence of numerous hot springs, feeder dykes for Deccan Traps and seismicity all along its length. It is divided in two parts by the Barwani-Sukta Fault, (BSF). To the west of this fault a graben exists, whereas to the east the basement is uplifted between Narmada North Fault (NNF) and Narmada South Fault (NSF). The present work deals with the 2-D thermal modeling to delineate the crustal thermal structure of the western part of NSL region along the Thuadara-Sindad Deep Seismic Sounding (DSS) profile which runs almost in the N-S direction across the NSL. Numerical results of the model reveal that the conductive surface heat flow value in the region under consideration varies between 45 and 47 mW/m2. Out of which 23 mW/m2 is the contribution from the mantle heat flow and the remaining from within the crust. The Curie depth is found to vary between 46 and 47 km and is in close agreement with the earlier reported Curie depth estimated from the analysis of MAGSAT data. The Moho temperature varies between 470 and 500°C. This study suggests that this western part of central Indian region is characterized by low mantle heat flow which in turn makes the lower crust brittle and amenable to the occurrence of deep focused earthquakes such as Satpura (1938) earthquake. {\textcopyright} Printed in India.},

abstract = {The breakup of the supercontinent Gondwanaland into Africa, Antarctica, Australia and India about 140 million years ago, and consequently the opening of the Indian Ocean, is thought to have been caused by heating of the lithosphere from below by a large plume whose relicts are now the Marion, Kerguelen and R{\'{e}}union plumes. Plate reconstructions based on palaeomagnetic data suggest that the Indian plate attained a very high speed (18-20 cm yr-1during the late Cretaceous period) subsequent to its breakup from Gondwanaland, and then slowed to ∼5 cm yr-1after the continental collision with Asia ∼50 Myr ago. The Australian and African plates moved comparatively less distance and at much lower speeds of 2-4 cm yr-1(refs 3-5). Antarctica remained almost stationary. This mobility makes India unique among the fragments of Gondwanaland. Here we propose that when the fragments of Gondwanaland were separated by the plume, the penetration of their lithospheric roots into the asthenosphere were important in determining their speed. We estimated the thickness of the lithospheric plates of the different fragments of Gondwanaland around the Indian Ocean by using the shear-wave receiver function technique. We found that the fragment of Gondwanaland with clearly the thinnest lithosphere is India. The lithospheric roots in South Africa, Australia and Antarctica are between 180 and 300 km deep, whereas the Indian lithosphere extends only about 100 km deep. We infer that the plume that partitioned Gondwanaland may have also melted the lower half of the Indian lithosphere, thus permitting faster motion due to ridge push or slab pull. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Recent seismicity in the northeast India and its adjoining region exhibits different earthquake mechanisms - predominantly thrust faulting on the eastern boundary, normal faulting in the upper Himalaya, and strike slip in the remaining areas. A homogenized catalogue in moment magnitude, M (W), covering a period from 1906 to 2006 is derived from International Seismological Center (ISC) catalogue, and Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT) database. Owing to significant and stable earthquake recordings as seen from 1964 onwards, the seismicity in the region is analyzed for the period with spatial distribution of magnitude of completeness m(t), b value, a value, and correlation fractal dimension D-C. The estimated value of m(t) is found to vary between 4.0 and 4.8. The a value is seen to vary from 4.47 to 8.59 while b value ranges from 0.61 to 1.36. Thrust zones are seen to exhibit predominantly lower b value distribution while strike-slip and normal faulting regimes are associated with moderate to higher b value distribution. D (C) is found to vary from 0.70 to 1.66. Although the correlation between spatial distribution of b value and D (C) is seen predominantly negative, positive correlations can also be observed in some parts of this territory. A major observation is the strikingly negative correlation with low b value in the eastern boundary thrust region implying a possible case of extending asperity. Incidentally, application of box counting method on fault segments of the study region indicates comparatively higher fractal dimension, D, suggesting an inclination towards a planar geometrical coverage in the 2D spatial extent. Finally, four broad seismic source zones are demarcated based on the estimated spatial seismicity patterns in collaboration with the underlying active fault networks. The present work appraises the seismicity scenario in fulfillment of a basic groundwork for seismic hazard assessment in this earthquake province of the country.},

abstract = {A number of possible mechanisms have recently been proposed for driving the motions of the lithospheric plates, such as pushing from mid-ocean ridges, pulling by downgoing slabs, suction toward trenches, and coupling of the plates to flow in the mantle. We advance a new observational method of testing these theories of the driving mechanism. Our basic approach is to solve the inverse problem of determining the relative strength of the plausible driving forces, given the observed motions and geometries of the lithospheric plates. Since the inertia of the plates is negligible, each plate must be in dynamic equilibrium, so that the sum of the torques acting on a plate must be zero. Thus, our problem is to determine the relative sizes of the forces that minimize the components of net torque on each plate. The results indicate that the forces acting on the downgoing slab control the velocity of the oceanic plates and are an order of magnitude stronger than any other force. Namely, all the oceanic plates attached to substantial amounts of downgoing slabs move with a ' terminal velocity ' at which the gravitational body force pulling the slabs downward is nearly balanced with the resistance acting on the slab; regardless of the other features of the trailing horizontal part of the plates. The drag on the bottom of the plates which resist motion is stronger under the continents than under the oceans},

abstract = {Earthquake stability assessment of large opencast mine slopes are complex and non-linear problems, often addressed using pseudo-static approaches neglecting material-induced failures and the role of pore-fluids. In this study, a numerical approach is used to understand the dynamic response of saturated and partially saturated soils. For this purpose user-defined elements have been implemented in Abaqus/Standard including user-defined material models. The governing equations involving coupled fluid flow and finite deformation processes in partially saturated soils are derived within the framework of the Theory of Porous Media. The stress-strain behavior of granular soils is represented by a hypoplastic constitutive model and for clayey soils the ISA-Clay model is used. The saturation-suction behavior is modeled using the van Genuchten model. To account for the large scale of the finite element model, a scaling procedure of the system of equations is proposed to purge the influence of initial stress. The performance of the user-defined elements is tested by back analysis of a centrifuge test available in the literature. Finally, large-scale fully coupled finite element simulations are performed to study the response of a flooded opencast mine under earthquake loading. The paper illustrates the importance of accounting the pore-fluids as independent phases in the context of seismic analysis of slopes and the influence of simplifications on which the calculation is based are highlighted. The simulations show strong wave diffraction effects for inhomogeneous dump structures, resulting in smaller displacements in near-surface areas of the slope. Further it was found that large areas of the dump show a temporary decrease of effective stress. The initial strong differences in stiffness between the different materials may decrease with time after several seismic events due stress redistributions caused by earthquakes.},

abstract = {We model evolution of a continent-continent collision and draw some parallels with the tectonic evolution of the Himalaya. We use a large-scale visco-plasto-elastic thermomechanical model that has a free upper surface, accounts for erosion and deposition and allows for all modes of lithospheric deformation. For quartz/olivine rheology and 60 mm/yr convergence rate, the continental subduction is stable, and the model predicts three distinct phases. During the phase 1 (120 km or 6{\%} of shortening), deformation is characterized by back thrusting around the suture zone. Some amount of delaminated lower crust accumulates at depth. During phase 2 (120 km{\&}{\#}8211;420 km or 6{\%}{\&}{\#}8211;22{\%} of shortening), this crustal root is exhumed (medium- to high-grade rocks) along a newly formed major thrust fault. This stage bears similarities with the period of coeval activity of the Main Central thrust and of the South Tibetan Detachment between 20{\&}{\#}8211;16 Myr ago. During phase 3 ({\textgreater}420 km or 22{\%} of shortening), the crust is scraped off from the mantle lithosphere and is incorporated into large crustal wedge. Deformation is localized around frontal thrust faults. This kinematics should produce only low- to medium-grade exhumation. This stage might be compared with the tectonics that has prevailed in the Himalaya over the last 15 Myr allowing for the formation of the Lesser Himalaya. The experiment is conducted at constant convergence rate, which implies increasing compressive force. Considering that this force is constant in nature, this result may be equivalent to a slowing down of the convergence rate as was observed during the India-Asia collision.},

abstract = {[1] Dislocation models can simulate static deformation caused by slip along a fault. These models usually take the form of a dislocation embedded in a homogeneous, isotropic, Poisson-solid half-space (HIPSHS). However, the widely accepted HIPSHS assumptions poorly approximate subduction zone systems of converging oceanic and continental crust. This study uses three-dimensional finite element models (FEMs) that allow for any combination ( including none) of the HIPSHS assumptions to compute synthetic Green's functions for displacement. Using the 1995 M-w = 8.0 Jalisco-Colima, Mexico, subduction zone earthquake and associated measurements from a nearby GPS array as an example, FEM-generated synthetic Green's functions are combined with standard linear inverse methods to estimate dislocation distributions along the subduction interface. Loading a forward HIPSHS model with dislocation distributions, estimated from FEMs that sequentially relax the HIPSHS assumptions, yields the sensitivity of predicted displacements to each of the HIPSHS assumptions. For the subduction zone models tested and the specific field situation considered, sensitivities to the individual Poisson-solid, isotropy, and homogeneity assumptions can be substantially greater than GPS measurement uncertainties. Forward modeling quantifies stress coupling between the M-w = 8.0 earthquake and a nearby M-w = 6.3 earthquake that occurred 63 days later. Coulomb stress changes predicted from static HIPSHS models cannot account for the 63-day lag time between events. Alternatively, an FEM that includes a poroelastic oceanic crust, which allows for postseismic pore fluid pressure recovery, can account for the lag time. The pore fluid pressure recovery rate puts an upper limit of 10(-17) m(2) on the bulk permeability of the oceanic crust.},

abstract = {Objectives: The SMART (Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends) surveillance programme was begun in 2002 to monitor antimicrobial resistance trends among aerobic and facultative Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) isolated from intra-abdominal infections worldwide. Methods: In 2003, 74 medical centres from 23 countries collected isolates for testing. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using broth microdilution according to the NCCLS guidelines for MIC testing. Results: A total of 5658 aerobic and facultative GNB were isolated from intra-abdominal infections. Enterobacteriaceae composed 84{\%} of the total isolates. Among the agents tested, the carbapenems were the most consistently active against the Enterobacteriaceae. E. coli was the most common isolate (46{\%}), and the susceptibility rate to the quinolone (70-90{\%} susceptible), cephalosporin (80-97{\%} susceptible), aminoglycoside (77-100{\%} susceptible) and carbapenem (99-100{\%} susceptible) agents tested varied among geographic regions, with isolates from the Asia/Pacific region generally being the most resistant. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were detected phenotypically in 9{\%} of E. coli, 14{\%} of Klebsiella spp., and 14{\%} of Enterobacter spp. worldwide. ESBL producers generally had a more antibiotic-resistant profile than non-ESBL producers. Conclusions: Antimicrobial resistance among GNB isolated from intra-abdominal infections is a problem worldwide, especially in the Asia/Pacific region. The carbapenems ertapenem, meropenem and imipenem are highly active in vitro against Enterobacteriaceae isolated from intra-abdominal sites, including organisms that produce ESBLs. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005.

abstract = {Since 9/11, the crash of a commercial aeroplane on the reactor building of a nuclear power plant is a realistic design scenario. Before that the structural behaviour under a crash of a military plane was investigated by a procedure using load-time functions (Riera, 1968). Thereby, the computation of the load-time-function was based on a conceptional model considering the main stiffness parts and masses by discrete elements. With respect to the homogeneous structural set-up of a military plane, the application of this model and the derived load-time-function applied as lumped load case seems very feasible. Contrary thereto the structural set-up of a commercial aeroplane, with e.g. the high mass concentration of the turbine or the high stiffness of the wing box compared to other parts, is different. This can be counteracted by using a more detailed finite element (FE) model for the computation of the load-time-function and by dividing the load case for the reactor building in different main load zones. Although this represents a more detailed investigation, the procedure of using a load-time-function still has the disadvantage to separate the real scenario into two steps. Thereby, the direct interaction between the structure and the aeroplane including all softening effects due to material respectively structural compliances is neglected. This leads to the general conclusion that by applying load-time-functions the results are conservative compared to the real behaviour. Due to the increased capabilities of numerical software solutions it is also possible nowadays to carry out integral crash simulations, combining all effects within one simulation. Compared to the procedure of using load-time-functions, the numerical complexity and therefore the amount of work for this integral method are increased. Within this paper both procedures (load-time function by detailed FE-model and the integral method) are exemplarily compared to each other by a crash analysis of an Airbus type A320 with different velocities (80, 120 and 160 m/s) on simplified reactor building. The final evaluation is carried out by the maximum displacement of the reinforced concrete reactor building wall being a criterion for the integrity of the building. With respect to the results it could be shown, that the procedure using load-time-functions has limitations for the investigation of some scenarios. This could finally lead to the decision that for the design process of new nuclear power plants the application of the integral method comprehends advantages that justify the additional efforts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The Deccan volcanism at Cretaceous-Tertiary ({\~{}}65 Ma) is the last major tectono-thermal event, which influenced a substantial part of the south Indian shield. To understand the influence of the Deccan volcanism on the evolution of the south Indian shield, we study the crustal seismic structure of the {\~{}}65 Ma Deccan Volcanic Province and the adjacent {\~{}}2.6 Ga Eastern Dharwar Craton (EDC), which forms the basement of the volcanic terrain.

The analysis and modelling, using H-Vp/Vs stacking and generalized neighbourhood algorithm inversion of the receiver functions show distinct crustal structure (crustal thickness, average composition, shear wave velocity variation, nature of crust-mantle boundary, etc.) across the EDC and DVP. The results clearly indicate that the crustal structure is heterogeneous beneath the DVP compared to a relatively uniform structure below the EDC. Using results from this study along with earlier results, we infer that the present Eastern Dharwar Craton terrain is not affected by any tectono-thermal event for a long geological time, including the Deccan volcanism. Whereas, the present Deccan Volcanic Province is highly affected by the Reunion mantle plume-crust interaction.},

abstract = {Introduction: Bacteria within the family Enterobacteriaceae are important pathogens in nosocomial and community settings. Over the past two decades, antimicrobial resistance among Enterobacteriaceae dramatically escalated worldwide. The authors review the mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance among Enterobacteriaceae, epidemiology and global spread of resistance elements and discuss therapeutic options. Areas covered: An exhaustive search for literature relating to Enterobacteriaceae was performed using PubMed, using the following key words: Enterobacteriaceae; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Escherichia coli; antimicrobial resistance; plasmids; global epidemiology; carbapenemases (CPEs); extended spectrum $\beta$-lactamases (ESBLs) and multidrug resistance (MDR). Expert opinion: Enterobacteriaceae are inhabitants of intestinal flora and spread easily among humans (via hand carriage, contaminated food or water or environmental sources). Antimicrobial resistance may develop via plasmids, transposons or other mobile resistance elements. Mutations conferring resistance typically increase over time; the rate of increase is amplified by selection pressure from antibiotic use. Factors that enhance spread of antimicrobial resistance include: crowding; lack of hygiene; overuse and over-the-counter use of antibiotics; tourism; refugees and international travel. Clonal spread of resistant organisms among hospitals, geographic regions and continents has globally fueled the explosive rise in resistance. The emergence and widespread dissemination of MDR clones containing novel resistance elements (particularly ESBLs and CPEs) has greatly limited therapeutic options. In some cases, infections due to MDR Enterobacteriaceae are untreatable with existing antimicrobial agents. The authors discuss current and future therapeutic options for difficult-to-treat infections due to these organisms. {\textcopyright} 2013 Informa UK, Ltd.},

Results suggest that deformation prediction sensitivities attributed to neglecting the different material properties of the subduction zone can be more than an order of magnitude greater than reported uncertainties for near-field GPS measurements. The FEM-based techniques presented here allow for geologically satisfying deformation models that will advance the reliability of modeling-based assessments of coseismic and postseismic deformation, stress-coupling, and tsunami genesis.},

An alternative, that is more consistent with the physical behaviour of these materials when sheared (a frictional behaviour) and which is strictly related to the volumetric strains, makes use of the angle of dilatancy and the effective angle of friction. In practical applications concerning the types of soils mentioned above, the elastic perfectly plastic non-associated Mohr-Coulomb model is still widely used and a quantification of the angle of dilatancy through soil testing is then necessary. Nevertheless this quantification is not always obvious due to ambiguous definitions present in the literature.

abstract = {The crustal structures of the Narmada region in Central India bounded by fault system (Narmada- North and South faults: NNF and NSF) has been derived from deep seismic sounding (DSS) studies along the two profiles trending almost north-south direction. The wide-angle phases have been modeled kinematically and dynamically using the 2-D asymptotic ray tracing technique. The combined seismic and gravity modeling reveals a multilayer crust in the region. The crustal wide-angle reflection phases map the Moho discontinuity, where the P-wave velocity jumps from 7.2 km s-1 to 8.0-8.1 km s-1, at depth varying between 38 km and 44 km. A layer with velocity 7.2 km s-1, exists above the Moho in most parts of the profiles and is attributed to the magmatic underplating related to the Deccan volcanism ({\~{}}65 Ma). The intriguing observation of the study is a zone characterized by anomalous high velocity (6.5-6.6 km s-1) within the upper crust. 2-D gravity modeling demonstrates that this anomalous layer has a density of {\~{}}2.9 gm cm-3, which is equivalent to the rocks metamorphosed to granulite/amphibolite facies. This high velocity layer probably represents the granulite enclaves within the Archaean granites/gneiss rocks and was formed during the cratonization of the Achaean crust. Importantly, this high velocity layer shows an average upward displacement of {\~{}}8.5 km within the region bounded by NNF and NSF as compared to the regions beyond it. The studies suggest that the observed displacement in the high velocity layer of the upper crust is a result of repeated reactivation of the Narmada fault system.},

We reconcile the discrepancy between the geodetic and the geological crustal shortening using geodynamic modeling that includes timescale-dependent crustal deformation. The GPS velocities reflect the instantaneous deformation in the Andes that includes both permanent deformation and elastic deformation that will be recovered during future earthquakes, whereas the lower geological rates reflect only the permanent deformation. The three-dimensional viscoelastic model predicts nearly uniform short-term velocity gradients across the Andes, similar to the GPS results, and concentrated long-term crustal shortening in the sub-Andean thrust zone, consistent with geological observations.},

abstract = {In order to model brittle fracture, we have implemented a two and three dimensional phase-field method in the commercial finite element code Abaqus/Standard. The method is based on the rate-independent variational principle of diffuse fracture. The phase-field is a scalar variable between 0 and 1 which connects broken and unbroken regions. If its value reaches one the material is fully broken, thus both its stiffness and stress are reduced to zero. The elastic displacement and the fracture problem are decoupled and solved separately as a staggered solution. The approach does not need predefined cracks and it can simulate curvilinear fracture paths, branching and even crack coalescence. Several examples are provided to explain the advantages and disadvantages of the method. The provided source codes and the tutorials make it easy for practicing engineers and scientists to model diffuse crack propagation in a familiar computational environment.},

abstract = {Interactions between subduction dynamics and magma genesis have been intensely investigated, resulting in several conceptual models derived from geological, geochemical and geophysical data. To provide physico-chemical constraints on these conceptual models, self-consistent numerical simulations containing testable thermo-mechanical parameters are required, especially considering the three-dimensional (3D) natural complexity of subduction systems. Here, we use a 3D high-resolution petrological and thermo-mechanical numerical model to quantify the relative contribution of oceanic and continental subduction/collision, slab roll-back and tearing to magma genesis and transport processes. Our modeling results suggest that the space and time distribution and composition of magmas in the overriding plate is controlled by the 3D slab dynamics and related asthenospheric flow. Moreover, the decrease of the bulk lithospheric strength induced by mantle- and crust-derived magmas promotes the propagation of strike-slip and extensional fault zones through the overriding crust as response to slab roll-back and continental collision. Reduction of the lithosphere/asthenosphere rheological contrast by lithospheric weakening also favors the transmission of velocities from the flowing mantle to the crust. Similarities between our modeling results and the late Cenozoic tectonic and magmatic evolution across the eastern Mediterranean region suggest an efficient control of mantle flow on the magmatic activity in this region, which in turn promotes lithospheric deformation by mantle drag via melt-induced weakening effects.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the seismic response analysis of an internal shearwall of a typical Indian reactor resting on a medium dense sandy silty soil, incorporating the nonlinear behavior of the soil-foundation interface. The modeling is done in an open-source finite element framework, OpenSees, where the soil-structure interaction (SSI) is modeled using a Beam-on-Nonlinear- Winkler-Foundation (BNWF) approach. Static pushover analysis and cyclic analysis are performed followed by an incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) with 30 recorded ground motions. For performing IDA, the spectral acceleration of each motion corresponding to the fundamental period, Sa(T1)is incremented from 0.1 g to 1.0 g with an increment step of 0.1 g. It is observed from the cyclic analysis that the equivalent viscous damping of the system increases upto twice upon incorporation of inelastic SSI. The IDA results demonstrate that the average peak base shear, base moment and displacement ductility demand reduces as much as 62{\%}, 40{\%}, and 35{\%}, respectively, whereas the roof drift demand increases up to 25{\%} upon consideration of foundation nonlinearity for the highest intensity motion. These observations indicate the need of critical consideration of nonlinear soil-structure interaction as any deficient modeling of the same may lead to an inaccurate estimation of the seismic demands of the structure.{\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We estimated an absolute tectonic plate motion model made up of 14 major plates, using velocities of 206 sites of high geodetic quality (far from plate boundaries, deformation zones and Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) regions), derived from and consistent with ITRF2008. The precision of the estimated model is evaluated to be at the level of 0.3 mm/a WRMS. No GIA corrections were applied to site velocities prior to estimating plate rotation poles, as our selected sites are outside the Fennoscandia regions where the GIA models we tested are performing reasonably well, and far from GIA areas where the models would degrade the fit (Antarctica and North America). Our selected velocity field has small origin rate bias components following the three axis (X, Y, Z), respectively 0.41 ±0.54, 0.22 ±0.64 and 0.41 ±0.60 (95 per cent confidence limits). Comparing our model to NNR-NUVEL-1A and the newly available NNR-MORVEL56, we found better agreement with NNR-MORVEL56 than with NNR-NUVEL-1A for all plates, except for Australia where we observe an average residual rotation rate of 4 mm/a. Using our selection of sites, we found large global X-rotation rates between the two models (0.016°/Ma) and between our model and NNR-MORVEL56 of 0.023/Ma, equivalent to 2.5 mm/a at the Earth surface. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {Modeling and analysis of gravity and earthquake data of a critically dynamic northeastern region of India assumes a special significance for understanding the seismicity and geodynamics. In this paper, the relation between lateral heterogeneity of gravity interfaces with subsurface structures, and seismic characteristics of northeast India are studied in detail to understand the seismicity and dynamics of the region using Bouguer gravity, earthquake and magnetotelluric data. The modern scaled power spectral analysis of gravity data has brought out crustal lateral heterogeneity at a depth of 8.33 km, 19.73 km and 37.14 km that correlate well with 10 km upper crust, 20 km lower crust and a Moho at 28–42 km revealed by 1D seismic crustal velocity and tomography studies. The inferred crustal depths support thinner crust over uplifted Shillong Plateau and gradual increase of depths over subduction interface of Indo Burmese Range. 2D gravity modeling constrained by seismic velocity model and 3D Euler deconvolution technique along two specific E-W and three N-S regional gravity transects delineated three significant high density anomalous heterogeneous intrusive bodies presumably due to underplating beneath Shillong Plateau, Mikir Massif and Indo Burmese Range. Based on the seismicity and stress pattern analysis through seismic ‘b'-value variation, we infer that the study region exhibits compressive stress concentrations in the form of brittle deformation at shallow depths and weakening of lower crust by high density intrusive (mafic/Ultramafic) bodies of ductile nature which may cause intense seismicity besides the ongoing collision of north drifting Indian plate with Eurasia to the north and the eastern subduction interface of Indo Burmese Range. We also infer that the NE to NW trending V-shaped areas outlined north of Shillong plateau, south of Mikir massif and NE-SW trending thrust Belt of Schuppen exhibit aseismic nature and may be the future impounding seismic sources in this region.},

abstract = {A 2-D numerical model for brittle creep and stress relaxation is proposed for the time-dependent brittle deformation of heterogeneous brittle rock under uniaxial loading conditions. The model accounts for material heterogeneity through a stochastic local failure stress field, and local material degradation using an exponential material softening law. Importantly, the model introduces the concept of a mesoscopic renormalization to capture the co-operative interaction between microcracks in the transition from distributed to localized damage. The model also describes the temporal and spatial evolution of acoustic emissions, including their size (energy released), in the medium during the progressive damage process. The model is first validated using previously published experimental data and is then used to simulate brittle creep and stress relaxation experiments. The model accurately reproduces the classic trimodal behaviour (primary, secondary and tertiary creep) seen in laboratory brittle creep (constant stress) experiments and the decelerating stress during laboratory stress relaxation (constant strain) experiments. Brittle creep simulations also show evidence of a 'critical level of damage' before the onset of tertiary creep and the initial stages of localization can be seen as early as the start of the secondary creep phase, both of which have been previously observed in experiments. Stress relaxation simulations demonstrate that the total amount of stress relaxation increases when the level of constant axial strain increases, also corroborating with previously published experimental data. Our approach differs from previously adopted macroscopic approaches, based on constitutive laws, and microscopic approaches that focus on fracture propagation. The model shows that complex macroscopic time-dependent behaviour can be explained by the small-scale interaction of elements and material degradation. The fact that the simulations are able to capture a similar time-dependent response of heterogeneous brittle rocks to that seen in the laboratory implies that the model is appropriate to investigate the non-linear complicated time-dependent behaviour of heterogeneous brittle rocks. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Geophysical Journal International {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

We used a snapshot of the stress distribution just before the earthquake in the quasi-static simulation. The resultant stress will be fed back to the quasi-static simulation. Since the quasi-static simulation used the slip-and time-dependent constitutive relation, the friction law itself evolves with time. Thus, we used the slip-weakening constitutive relation for dynamic rupture propagation consistent with that used for the quasi-static simulation.

abstract = {Active intraplate deformation of the India-Australia Plate is now being captured by far-field global positioning system (GPS) measurements as well as measurements on a few islands located within the deforming zone itself. In this paper, we combine global and regional geodetic solutions with focal mechanisms of earthquakes to derive the present-day strain field of the India-Australia Plate. We first compile an updated catalogue of 131 Indian intraplate earthquakes (M {\textgreater} 5) spanning the period between the two Asian mega earthquakes of Assam 1897 and Sumatra 2004. Using Haines and Holt's numerical approach applied to a fully deformable India-Australia Plate, we show that the use of GPS data only or earthquakes data only has severe drawbacks, related, respectively, to the small number of stations and the incompleteness of the earthquakes catalogue. The combined solution avoids underestimation of the strain inherent to the Kostrov summation of seismic moments and provides details that cannot be reached by pure GPS modelling. We further explore the role of heterogeneity of the India-Australia Plate and find that the best model, in terms of geodetic vectors fit, relative distribution of strain, style and direction of principal strain from earthquakes, is obtained using the surface heat-flow as a proxy for rheological weakness of the oceanic lithosphere. The present-day deformation is distributed around the Afanasy Nikitin Chain in the Central Indian Basin (CIB)-where it is almost pure shortening-and within the Wharton Basin (WB) off Sumatra-where it is almost pure lateral strike-slip. The northern portion of NinetyEast ridge (NyR) appears as a major discontinuity for both strain and velocity. The new velocity field gives an India/Australia rotation pole located at 11.3 degrees S, 72.8 degrees E (-0.301 degrees Myr(-1))overlapping with previous solutions, with continental India moving eastward at rates ranging from 13 mm yr(-1) (southern India) to 26 mm yr(-1) (northern India) with respect to Australia. Taking into account the intraplate velocity field in the vicinity of the Sumatra trench, we obtain a convergence rate of 46 mm yr(-1) towards N18 degrees E at the epicentre of the 2004 Aceh megaearthquake. The predicted instantaneous shortening in the CIB and WB and extension near Chagos-Laccadive are in good agreement with the finite deformation measured from plate reconstructions and seismic profiles, suggesting a continuum of deformation since the onset of intraplate deformation around 7.5-8 Ma. Since no significant change in India convergence is detected at that time, we suggest that the intraplate deformation started with the trenchward acceleration of Australia detaching from India along a wide left-lateral oceanic shear band activating the NyR line of weakness as well as north-south fracture zones east of it. The predicted total amount of left lateral finite strain along these faults is in the range 110-140 km.},

abstract = {Subduction of tectonic plates limited in lateral extent and with a free-trailing tail, i.e., "free subduction,'' is modeled in a three-dimensional (3-D) geometry. The models use a nonlinear viscoplastic rheology for the subducting plate and exhibit a wide range of behaviors depending on such plate characteristics as strength, width, and thickness. We investigate the time evolution of this progressive rollback subduction, measure the accompanying return flow in the upper mantle, and quantify the plate kinematics. Due to the 3-D geometry, flow is allowed to accompany slab rollback around the lateral edges of the slab (the toroidal component), as opposed to 2-D geometry, where material is forced to flow underneath the slab tip (the poloidal component). A simple force balance is provided which relates the speed of backward trench migration to the resistive forces of generating flow and weakening the plate. Our results indicate most of the gravitational energy of the system (i.e., the negative buoyancy of the subducting slab) is converted into a toroidal flow (∼69{\%}), a much smaller amount goes into weakening the plate (∼18{\%}), and the remaining amount goes into driving flow parallel to displacement of the slab (∼13{\%}). For the trench widths (W) we investigate (≤1500 km), a maximum trench retreat rate occurs for trenches 600 km wide, which is attributed to the interaction between a plate of finite width and the induced flow (which has a lengthscale in the horizontal direction). These numerical results quantitatively agree with comparable 3-D laboratory experiments using analogue models with a purely viscous plate material (Schellart, 2004a, 2004b), including correlations between increasing retreat rate with increasing plate thickness, trench width for maximum retreat rate (500 km), and estimated amount of slab buoyancy used to drive rollback-induced flow (∼70{\%}). Several implications for plate tectonics on Earth result from these models such as rollback subduction providing a physical mechanism for ephemeral slab graveyards situated above the more viscous lower mantle (and endothermic phase transition) prior to a flushing event into the lower mantle (mantle avalanche). {\textcopyright} Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Asolution algorithm based on three-dimensional (3D) finite-element analysis is presented to study the dynamic response of concrete pavements subjected to moving loads. The pavement is discretized by 20-node isoparametric brick elements. The supporting soil medium is idealized by the elastic continuum model. Kelvin elements are attached to the transmitting boundary separating the near field and far field of the infinite soil medium in the vertical and longitudinal directions. Three-dimensional, 16-node infinite elements are attached to the transmitting boundary in the longitudinal direction to simulate the infinite soil medium in vehicle traverse direction. The moving vehicle is modeled by a mass supported by a linear spring and dashpot assembly simulating the vehicle suspension system. The vehicle-pavement interaction force is modeled with a Dirac-delta function. The dynamic equilibrium equation is solved by applying the Newmark-Beta integration scheme. The effects of vehicle-pavement interaction, pavement thickness, and soil parameters on the dynamic response of pavement are investigated by conducting a parametric study. It has been observed that the dynamic interaction between the moving load and the pavement has a significant effect on pavement response. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract = {Paper reviews present literature recommendations on liquefaction of soils with fines starting with the experimental evidence previously published by the authors. The liquefaction behavior of silts and silt clay mixers was investigated over a range of plasticity index values of interest by conducting cyclic triaxial tests on reconstituted samples and their behavior was compared with that of sand. It was found that saturated silts with plastic fines behave differently from sands both with respect to rate of development of pore water pressure and axial deformations with number of load cycles. The results also showed that liquefaction susceptibility of silts shows a marked change with change in the values of plasticity index. For a PI range of 2-4{\%}, the liquefaction resistance of silt was found to decrease with an increase in plasticity. Some recent criteria may be helpful in deciding the liquefaction susceptibility of a fine grained soil. However, there is still considerable confusion in ascertaining their liquefaction susceptibility, based on simple field, and/or lab. tests.},

abstract = {In order to model any physical system, including concrete dams, one needs to apply simplifications to the real system to make the modeling feasible. To study the dynamic response of concrete dams, relevant assumptions are made regarding foundation modeling, input motion mechanism, dam-reservoir interaction, and material behavior. Some of these simplifications may lead to more conservative and uneconomical outcomes. In this paper, nonlinear time-domain dynamic analyses are conducted to evaluate the effect of the input motion mechanism on the concrete gravity dam response. An ideal model of a dam-reservoir-foundation system, considering the inertia of the foundation, appropriate boundary conditions and precise deconvolved base motions, is selected as the reference model. The process of deconvolution of seismic waves through the frequency- and time-domain approaches is discussed, and suggestions for the selection of an appropriate damping model for the rock foundation are presented. The results are compared to those of the standard model of a massless foundation system as recommended by the US Army Corps of Engineers. The numerical results indicate that, generally, the nonlinear response of the two dam models follow similar patterns, but with a larger amplitude for the massless system. It is noted that the consequence of neglecting the dynamic effect of the foundation can be significant. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the degree of overestimation varies dramatically for the various seismic excitations. The average overestimation of the massless system for the crest displacement, crest acceleration, and the contact opening and sliding are 57{\%}, 45{\%}, 152{\%}, and 90{\%}, respectively. It is further shown that the use of the deconvolved input excitation at the base of the finite foundation derived from the frequency-domain approach can yield discrepancies between the target and convolved surface ground motions, which can also have a considerable effect on the dam response.},

abstract = {Soil liquefaction is the failure or loss of shear strength of the cohesionless soil due to the sudden increase in pore water pressure causing the effective stress in the soil to reduce significantly due to an earthquake shaking. The Guwahati city in Assam is located in the Northeastern region (NE) of India and the whole region is considered to be the most seismically active zones in the country as well as globally in sixth position. There have been several major and great earthquakes in the past such as 1897 and 1950 earthquakes having magnitude Mw{\textgreater}8.0. The soil deposits of the city mainly consist of an alluvial type of Holocene age. The city has a non-cohesive soil deposit and the shallow ground water table at the various locations.In this study, an assessment of soil liquefaction potential of Guwahati city was performed based on the method suggested by Youd et al18. The evaluation of liquefaction potential was carried out considering the Great Shillong earthquake of Mw 8.1. A design peak ground acceleration of 0.36g used as the Guwahati city lies in the zone-V of the seismic zoning map of India as per IS 1893(part 1):2002. In this work, a total of 82 boreholes were collected from the city in such a way that it can cover the whole study area used for the assessment of liquefaction potential, the evaluation reveals that 34 sites are susceptible to soil liquefaction.The factor of safety (FOS) against soil liquefaction was determined for all the sites. The results are presented in the form of contour maps showing FOS against soil liquefaction at several depths. An evaluation of the severity of liquefaction in the form of liquefaction potential index (LPI) was also carried out based on the method proposed by Iwasaki et al.6,17 However, the LPI enables us to ascertain the severity of liquefaction and the results are presented in the form of contour maps at several depths. The present results would be helpful for the city planners, designers and the Govt. of Assam for disaster mitigation strategies.},

abstract = {Buildings constructed adjacent to the slope crest in seismically active areas might be exposed to serious danger when they are subjected to strong earthquake excitations. The ground conditions can influence the seismic response of structures through a phenomenon known as the slope-foundation-structure interaction. Indeed, the presence of the slope in the vicinity of a building foundation can significantly affect the seismic response of the superstructure. In this study, the impact of shallow slopes on the seismic performance of nearby buildings was numerically assessed. In the adopted three-dimensional finite-element simulation, the nonlinear variations of the soil stiffness and damping with the cyclic shear strain plus varying distances between the edge of the foundation and crest of the slope were employed. A 15-story moment-resisting structure, a 30-m-thick clayey deposit, and a 2-m-high shallow slope were considered as the benchmark model, being simulated using the direct method in the time domain. According to the results of the analyses, the seismic response of a building could be highly sensitive to the distance between the slope crest and foundation. Particularly, the building closer to the slope crest experienced more severe foundation rocking, lateral deformation, and interstory drifts owing to the amplified effect of the slope-foundation-structure interaction. Moreover, the results highlighted the importance of the slope-foundation-structure interaction in altering the natural period and damping of the system. Hence, it is critical for practicing engineers to assess the impact of nearby slopes on the seismic performance of structures with extreme care to ensure the reliability and safety of the design.},

abstract = {The S wave velocity structure of the crust and uppermost mantle of the Indian shield has been investigated by jointly inverting P wave receiver functions and Rayleigh wave group velocities at 38 broadband stations in the subcontinent. The Indian shield is an amalgamation of several terranes of Archean and Proterozoic age that were partly flooded by Deccan Trap volcanism during Cenozoic times and that make up a natural laboratory for assessing models of Precambrian crustal evolution. Our results reveal significant variations in crustal thickness and deep crustal velocities: 45-50 km thick under the Archean West Dharwar craton and Southern Granulite Terrane, with lower crustal velocities around 4.1 km/s; 32-35 km thick beneath the Archean East Dharwar and Bundelkhand cratons, with lower crustal velocities around 3.8-3.9 km/s; 50-65 km thick under the Proterozoic Bhandara craton, with lower crustal velocities around 4.2-4.3 km/s; and ∼55 km thick under the Proterozoic Aravalli-Delhi belt, with lower crustal velocities around 4.2 km/s. S velocities in the 4.1-4.3 km/s range in the deep crust can be attributed to mafic lithologies, suggesting there has been no secular change in the Precambrian evolution of the south Indian shield. Moreover, pervasive mafic dike swarming throughout the Indian shield suggests that the layer of mafic cumulates is 2.5-1.6 Ga old and that it delaminated from some Archean terranes. Our interpretation is that mafic underplating of the terranes making up the Indian shield occurred in Proterozoic times and that a refractory root developed under the Archean terranes after the Proterozoic event.

abstract = {Subduction of young oceanic lithosphere cannot be explained by the gravitational driving mechanisms of slab pull and ridge push. This deficiency of driving forces can be overcome by obduction of an actively overriding plate, which forces the young plate either to subduct or to collide. This mechanism leads to shallow flattening of the slab as observed today under parts of the west coast of North and South America. Here this process is examined by means of numerical modeling. The convergence velocity between oceanic and continental lithospheric plates is computed from the modeling results, and the ratio of the subduction velocity over the overriding velocity is used as a diagnostic of the efficiency of the ongoing subduction process. We have investigated several factors influencing the mechanical resistance working against the subduction process. In particular, we have studied the effect of a preexisting lithospheric fault with a depth dependent shear resistance, partly decoupling the oceanic lithosphere from the overriding continent. We also investigated the lubricating effect of a 7 km thick basaltic crustal layer on the efficiency of the subduction process and found a log-linear relation between convergence rate and viscosity prefactor characterizing the strength of the oceanic crust, for a range of parameter values including values for basaltic rocks, derived from empirical data. A strong mantle fixes the subducting slab while being overridden and prevents the slab from further subduction in a Benioff style. Viscous heating lowers the coupling strength of the crustal interface between the converging plates with about half an order of magnitude and therefore contributes significantly to the subduction process. Finally, when varying the overriding velocity from 2.5 to 10 cm yr-1, we found a non-linear increase of the subduction velocity due to the presence of non-linear mantle rheology. These results indicate that active obduction of oceanic lithosphere by an overriding continental lithosphere is a viable mechanism for shallow flat subduction over a wide range of model parameters.

abstract = {Recent seismicity in the northeast India and its adjoining region exhibits different earthquake mechanisms - predominantly thrust faulting on the eastern boundary, normal faulting in the upper Himalaya, and strike slip in the remaining areas. A homogenized catalogue in moment magnitude, M (W), covering a period from 1906 to 2006 is derived from International Seismological Center (ISC) catalogue, and Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT) database. Owing to significant and stable earthquake recordings as seen from 1964 onwards, the seismicity in the region is analyzed for the period with spatial distribution of magnitude of completeness m(t), b value, a value, and correlation fractal dimension D-C. The estimated value of m(t) is found to vary between 4.0 and 4.8. The a value is seen to vary from 4.47 to 8.59 while b value ranges from 0.61 to 1.36. Thrust zones are seen to exhibit predominantly lower b value distribution while strike-slip and normal faulting regimes are associated with moderate to higher b value distribution. D (C) is found to vary from 0.70 to 1.66. Although the correlation between spatial distribution of b value and D (C) is seen predominantly negative, positive correlations can also be observed in some parts of this territory. A major observation is the strikingly negative correlation with low b value in the eastern boundary thrust region implying a possible case of extending asperity. Incidentally, application of box counting method on fault segments of the study region indicates comparatively higher fractal dimension, D, suggesting an inclination towards a planar geometrical coverage in the 2D spatial extent. Finally, four broad seismic source zones are demarcated based on the estimated spatial seismicity patterns in collaboration with the underlying active fault networks. The present work appraises the seismicity scenario in fulfillment of a basic groundwork for seismic hazard assessment in this earthquake province of the country.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Based on structural dynamics theory, the modal pushover analysis (MPA) procedure retains the conceptual simplicity of current procedures with invariant force distribution, now common in structural engineering practice. The MPA procedure for estimating seismic demands is extended to unsymmetric-plan buildings. In the MPA procedure, the seismic demand due to individual terms in the modal expansion of the effective earthquake forces is determined by non-linear static analysis using the inertia force distribution for each mode, which for unsymmetric buildings includes two lateral forces and torque at each floor level. These 'modal' demands due to the first few terms of the modal expansion are then combined by the CQC rule to obtain an estimate of the total seismic demand for inelastic systems. When applied to elastic systems, the MPA procedure is equivalent to standard response spectrum analysis (RSA). The MPA estimates of seismic demand for torsionally-stiff and torsionally-flexible unsymmetric systems are shown to be similarly accurate as they are for the symmetric building; however, the results deteriorate for a torsionally-similarly-stiff unsymmetric-plan system and the ground motion considered because (a) elastic modes are strongly coupled, and (b) roof displacement is underestimated by the CQC modal combination rule (which would also limit accuracy of RSA for linearly elastic systems). {\textcopyright} 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Most probabilistic seismic-hazard analysis procedures require that at least three seismic source parameters be known, namely the mean seismic activity rate $\lambda$, the Gutenberg–Richter b-value, and the area-characteristic (seismogenic source) maximum possible earthquake magnitude mmaxIn almost all currently used seismic-hazard assessment procedures that utilize these three parameters, it is explicitly assumed that all three remain constant over time and space. However, closer examination of most earthquake catalogs has indicated that significant spatial and temporal variations existed in the seismic activity rate $\lambda$, as well as in the Gutenberg–Richter b-value. In this study, the maximum likelihood estimation of these earthquake hazard parameters considers the incompleteness of the catalogs, the uncertainty in the earthquake magnitude determination, as well as the uncertainty associated with the applied earthquake-occurrence models. The uncertainty in the earthquake-occurrence models is introduced by assuming that both the mean seismic activity rate $\lambda$ and the Gutenberg–Richter b-value are random variables, each described by the gamma distribution. This approach results in the extension of the classic frequency–magnitude Gutenberg–Richter relation and the Poisson distribution of the number of earthquakes with their compounded counterparts (Benjamin, 1968; Campbell, 1982, 1983). The proposed procedure was applied in the estimation of the seismicity parameters in an area that had experienced the strongest and most devastating earthquake in contemporary South African history, namely the 29 September 1969 Mw6.3 Ceres–Tulbagh event. In this example, it was shown that the introduction of uncertainty in the earthquake-occurrence model reduced the mean return periods, leading to an increase of the estimated seismic hazard. Additionally, this study confirmed that accounting for magnitude uncertainties had the opposite effect, that is, it brought about increases in the return periods, or, equivalently, a reduction of the estimated seismic hazard.},

abstract = {We determined the relative mechanical strength of the Indian subcontinent by a robust coherence method based on multitaper spectral analysis on overlapping windows of equal size. Representing the elastic properties of the lithosphere by a transitional coherence wavelength, we bypass the need to input rheological variables such as Young's modulus or Poisson's ratio, which have been shown to vary on other continents. We compare our measurements in terms of age and find that regions underlain by Proterozoic basement are on average stronger than regions of Archaean age. This is in stark contrast to the common assumption that mechanical strength should increase progressively with time. This suggests they are indeed mechanically distinct, and that the transitional coherence wavelength adequately captures this distinction between regions of relative strength difference. Conversions of these values to absolute effective elastic thickness show a greater overlap, which is due to the many strong assumptions required in obtaining such absolute values and argues against their usage as a robust and well-constrained property of the elastic lithosphere. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The computed density model, constrained with seismic and other geophysical information, delineates high-density (3.1 g/cm3) underplated lower crust and low density (3.2 g/cm3) upper mantle along the west coast of India, which may be attributed to the interaction of the Reunion hot spot with the Indian lithosphere and rifting along the west coast of India. Analysis and modelling of the gravity data also suggest different sources for two large wave length gravity 'lows', namely the 'Koyna low' and the 'Kurduwadi low', observed over the DVP. The 'Koyna low' is caused mainly by isostatic compensation, manifested as crustal thickening upto 40 km with low density (3.2 g/cm3) upper mantle, while the source of the 'Kurduwadi low' appears to be shallow and is mainly attributed to the emplacement of low-density material, such as granitic bodies along fractures/shear zones.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The intra-plate region of the Northeast Indian Ocean, located between the Ninetyeast Ridge and the North West Shelf of Australia, contains numerous submerged seamounts and two sub-aerially exposed volcanic island groups. While the Cocos (Keeling) Archipelago is a coral atoll, Christmas Island is the only sub-aerially exposed volcanic island and contains Late Cretaceous, Eocene and Pliocene lavas. The lavas are predominantly basaltic in composition, except for one sampled flow that is trachytic. Although the evolution of the western margin of Australia, and the seismicity in the intra-plate region, has received considerable attention, the origin of the seamount province in the Northeast Indian Ocean is still a matter of debate. In order to constrain the origin of volcanism on Christmas Island and the associated Seamount Province we analysed 14 Christmas Island samples for major and trace element abundances and 12 of these for Nd, Hf and Pb isotope compositions. The trace element patterns of the lavas are similar to many ocean island basalts, while high 208Pb/204Pb and 207Pb/204Pb at a given 206Pb/204Pb suggest affiliation with the DUPAL anomaly. The reconstructed position of Christmas Island during the Eocene (44–37 Ma) places the island in close proximity to the (present-day) upper mantle low-seismic velocity anomalies. Moreover, an enriched mantle (EM-2) type component in addition to the DUPAL anomaly is observed in the Eocene volcanic phase. The younger Pliocene ({\~{}} 4 Ma) sequences at Christmas Island are inferred to be the product of partial melting of existing material induced by lithospheric flexure.},

abstract = {A damaging and widely felt moderate (Mw 5.0) earthquake occurred in the Talala region of Saurashtra, Gujarat (western India) on November 6, 2007. The highly productive sequence comprised about 1300 micro earthquakes (M{\textgreater}0.5) out of which 325 of M≥ 1.5 that occurred during November 6, 2007-January 10, 2008 were precisely located. The spatial aftershock distribution revealed a NE-SW striking fault in accordance with the centroid moment tensor solution, which in turn implies left-lateral motion. The orientation and sense of shear are consistent with similarly orientated geological fault identified in the area from satellite imagery and field investigation.The aftershocks temporal decay, b-value of frequency-magnitude distribution, spatial fractal dimension, D, and slip ratio (ratio of the slip occurred on the primary fault to the total slip) were examined with the purpose to identify the properties of the sequence. The high b-value (1.18 ± 0.01) may be attributed to the paucity of the larger (M≥4.0) aftershocks and reveals crustal heterogeneity and low stress regime. The high p-value (1.10 ± 0.39), implying fast decay rate of aftershocks, evidences high surface heat flux. A value of the spatial fractal dimension (D) equal to 2.21 ± 0.02 indicates random spatial distribution and source in a two-dimensional plane that is being filled-up by fractures. A slip ratio of 0.42 reveals that more slip occurred on secondary fault systems.The static Coulomb stress changes due to the coseismic slip of the main shock, enhanced off fault aftershock occurrence. The occurrence of a moderate earthquake (Mw 4.3) on October 5, 2008 inside a region of positive Coulomb stress changes supports the postulation on aftershock triggering. When the stress changes were resolved on a cross section including the stronger (M4.8) foreshock plane that is positioned adjacent to the main fault, it became evident that the activity continued there due to stress transfer from the main rupture. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper also presents the development of empirical relations to predict the F02DB of elliptical and trapezoidal basins for both the polarizations of the S wave. Simulated results revealed that F02DB of a 2-D basin very much depends on its geometry, shape ratio and polarization of the incident S wave. The obtained spectral amplification factor (SAF) at F02DS of a standalone structure in a 2-D basin is greater than that in the 1-D case under double resonance condition. A considerable reduction of the fundamental resonance frequency of structures due to the SCI effects is observed for both the polarizations of the S wave. The SAFs at FS 02D of closely spaced structures due to SCI effects is larger in the case of SV than SH waves. A splitting of the fundamental-mode frequency bandwidth along with the drastic decrease of SAF due to the SCI effects is obtained. The findings of this paper raise the question concerning the validity of the predicted response of standalone structure based on soil-structure interaction for the design of structures in a 2-D small basin, in an urban environment.},

abstract = {The Koyna earthquake (M 6.3) of reservoir triggered seismicity (RTS) nature took place five decades back on December 10, 1967 in the Deccan Trap covered region of western India. This prompted a large number of both Indian and international geo-scientists to undertake various studies, particularly passive seismological studies with full vigour. In addition to these, active seismic studies, then known as deep seismic sounding (DSS), were carried out across and near the Koyna epicentral region to delineate the crustal velocity structure and geotectonic features of the region. Data acquisition along two DSS profiles was undertaken during 1975–78. The results of such rarely undertaken studies were widely utilised by the global earth scientists. Here we relook at the results published since 1981, and try to assess the global impact of DSS study on the research output during the last four decades. After giving a brief summary on the data acquisition, processing and results, we provide relevant information such as the Trap thickness, basement configuration, regional crustal and subcrustal velocity structures, and deep seated features like faults with a view to relate with earthquake activities. Some concluding observations have also been made discussing the accuracy and likely validity of the DSS results, obtained using the then acquired data and processing methods, and unlikely reprocessing of the data using upgraded tools. New active experiments in the Koyna region are being suggested, particularly to decide about the proper locations of the deep geophysical boreholes down to the hypocenters on the ‘mapped' faults.},

These have also led to a better understanding of the thermal and mechanical coupling between mantle convection and surface plate motion and predictions of the configuration of the next supercontinent. The simulations of mantle convection from 200 Ma to the present reveals that the development of large-scale cold mantle downwellings in the North Tethys Ocean at the earlier stage of the Pangea breakup triggered the northward movement of the Indian subcontinent. The model of high temperature anomaly region beneath Pangea resulting from the thermal insulation effect support the breakup of Pangea in the real Earth time scale, as also suggested in previous geological and geodynamic models. However, considering the low radioactive heat generation rate of the depleted upper mantle, the high temperature anomaly region might have been generated by upwelling plumes with contribution of deep subducted TTG (tonalite-trondhjemite-granite) materials enriched in radiogenic elements. Integrating the numerical results of mantle convection from 200 Ma to the present, and from the present to the future, it is considered that the mantle drag force acting on the base of continents may be comparable to the slab pull force, which implies that convection in the shallower part of the mantle is strongly coupled with surface plate motion.},

abstract = {The past several years have witnessed an increase in research on the nonlinear analysis of the structures made from reinforced concrete. Several mathematical models were created to analyze the behavior of concrete and the reinforcements. Factors including inelasticity, time dependence, cracking and the interactive effects between reinforcement and concrete were considered. The crushing of the concrete in compression and the cracking of the concrete in tension are the two common failure modes of concrete. Material models were introduced for analyzing the behavior of unconfined concrete, and a possible constitutive model was the concrete damage plasticity (CDP) model. Due to the complexity of the CDP theory, the procedure was simplified and a simplified concrete damage plasticity (SCDP) model was developed in this paper. The SCDP model was further characterized in tabular forms to simulate the behavior of unconfined concrete. The parameters of the concrete damage plasticity model, including a damage parameter, strain hardening/softening rules, and certain other elements, were presented through the tables shown in the paper for concrete grades B20, B30, B40 and B50. All the aspects were discussed in relation to the effective application of a finite element method in the analysis. Finally, a simply supported prestressed beam was analyzed with respect to four different concrete grades through the finite element program. The results showed that the proposed model had good correlation with prior arts and empirical formulations.},

Peak ground acceleration (PGA) showed a variation from 0.04 to 0.36 g for DSHA, from 0.02 to 0.32 g and 0.092 to 0.1525 g for 2 and 10{\%} probability in 50 years, respectively.

@article{Rheology2013,
abstract = {In order to study the mechanical response of the lithosphere to various types of forces, one has to take into account its rheology, which literally means how it flows. This depends on the thermal structure, the fluid content, the thickness of compositional layers and various boundary conditions. Three main rheological modes determine the flow behaviour of Earth materials: elasticity, plastic yielding and viscous creep. In assessing flow processes in the lithosphere, each of these three modes will be considered. But an important factor is the time during which the load is applied. -At time scale of seismic waves (up to hundreds seconds) the sub-crustal mantle behaves elastically down to deep within the asthenosphere. -Over a few to thousands of years (e.g. ice cap), the mantle flows like a viscous fluid. -On long geological times (more than 1 million year), the upper crust and the upper mantle behave also as thin elastic plates that overlie an inviscid (i.e. with no viscosity) substratum. Both elasticity and viscosity are therefore ingredients of the mechanical behaviour of the lithosphere. The long-term mechanical attributes of the lithosphere are expressed in terms of lithospheric strength. This strength is estimated by integrating yield stress with depth. The current state of knowledge of rock rheology is sufficient to provide broad general outlines of mechanical behaviour, but also has substantial limitations. Two very thorny problems involve the scaling of rock properties with long time periods and for very large length scales. ELEMENTS OF RHEOLOGY Definitions Rheology describes the response of materials to an imposed stress system. This response varies considerably according to the physical conditions of deformation. Deformation can be either recoverable or permanent. Recoverable deformation is described by a time-independent strain-stress relation – when the stress is removed, the strain returns to zero. This includes elastic deformation and thermal expansion. Permanent deformation includes plastic and viscous flow or creep as well as brittle deformation (faulting, cracking, etc.) and requires time-dependent relations. The flow behaviour of rocks to applied loads is empirically derived from laboratory experiments and can be compared to theoretical constitutive equations. Gross geological differentiation},

abstract = {An understanding of the sedimentary and crustal structure of the Bengal Basin and of the tectonics deforming it remains elusive due to lack of seismic data from Bangladesh. Taking advantage of recently available data from 11 seismic stations deployed over Bangladesh, we determine the crustal structure beneath each station using 2768 high quality receiver functions (RFs). Inversion of the RFs reveals a highly variable thickness of the overlying sediments beneath the Bengal Basin. The thickness of the sediments increases dramatically across the Hinge Zone of the Early Cretaceous passive margin from 3 to 17 km. The thick sediments partly represent progradation of the continental margin due to the influx of clastic sediments from the Himalayas. The Moho shallows across the region. This reflects thinning of the crystalline crust from 38 km in the Indian Craton to 34 km at the Hinge Zone to {\textless}. 16 km in the Bengal Basin. The thickness of the sediments increases dramatically from 3 to 17 km south of Madhupur tract which reflects the regions of highest influx of clastic sediments from the Himalayan collision zone. RFs display strong dipping reflectors (strike 67°) for a station over Hinge Zone and seem to be associated with the transition from continental to oceanic crust. The thinning of significant crustal thickness (16-19 km) beneath 15-17 km of sediment and associated velocities ({\textgreater}. 4.0 km/s) at lower crustal levels supports an influence of the Kerguelen plume igneous activity during rifting. We invert data for a station near the Dauki Fault, which marks the southern boundary of the uplifted Shillong plateau, for dip and anisotropic effects. Our results show the Dauki as a north-dipping thrust fault at Jaflong with a dip angle of 32° and strike (110°) close to its surficial expression. A strong anisotropy ({\~{}}. 15{\%}) and the sense of shear (plunge: 24°, trend: 79°) compliment the dipping geometry and deformation seems to be related to the initiation of the Dauki Fault.},

abstract = {The evidence of east-west compression in northeast Japan has been reported by many investigators on the basis of geodetic, geologic and geomorphic data, but its origin still remains far from understood. In the present study we have proposed a mechanical model of tectonic loading at convergent plate boundary zones, and demonstrated its validity through the numerical simulation of internal stress fields in northeast Japan with realistic 3-D geometry of plate interfaces. At convergent plate boundary zones, in general, a part of plate convergence is consumed by steady slip along plate interfaces, and the remaining part by inelastic deformation (seismic faulting, aseismic faulting, and active folding) of overriding plates. Such a plate boundary process to be called "partial collision" can be quantitatively described by introducing a collision rate defined as c = 1 - steady slip rate at plate interfaces/plate convergence rate. By this definition, we can simply represent the mechanical process of partial collision, which includes total subduction (c = 0) and total collision (c = 1) as two extreme cases, in terms of steady slip rates at plate interfaces. On the basis of elastic dislocation theory, first, we numerically computed the internal stress fields in northeast Japan produced by the total subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the North American plate, however the computed stress pattern was opposite in sense to observations. Then, we computed the internal stress fields by taking c = 0.1 on average, and succeeded in reproducing the observed east-west compression in northeast Japan. This indicates that the concept of partial collision is essential to understand the mechanism of intraplate tectonic loading. {\textcopyright} Birkh{\"{a}}user Verlag, Basel, 2006.},

Based on the further development platform provided by ABAQUS, the HISS model was programmed into a three dimensional user-material subroutine (UMAT). Three kinds of triaxial tests (HC, TC and TE) and several proportional loading tests of Munich sand were simulated by ABAQUS with the developed model.

The numerical predictions show good agreement with the observed behavior in experiments, which verified the UMAT and proved the applicability of HISS model to sands.

abstract = {We modelled the state of stress in the Indo-Australian plate in order to investigate quantitatively variations observed in tectonic style. The numerical procedure incorporates the dependence of slab pull and ridge push on the age of the oceanic lithosphere. Estimates are presented for the average net resistive forces at the Himalayan collision zone, the suction force acting on the overriding Indo-Australian plate segment at the Tonga-Kermadec trench and the drag at the base of the lithosphere. Our modelling shows a concentration of compressive stresses of the order of 3-5 kbar in the Ninetyeast Ridge area; the effects of the compressive resistance associated with Himalayan collision and subduction of young lithosphere off the northern part of the Sunda arc are focused in this region. The stress field as calculated gives a consistent explanation for the observed concentration of seismic activity (Stein and Okal, 1978) and significant deformation in the oceanic crust (Weissel et al., 1980; McAdoo and Sandwell, 1985) in the area. The calculated stress field in the area adjacent to the Southeast and Central India ridges is characterized by tension parallel to the spreading axis. This explains the concentration of near-ridge normal faulting seismicity (with T-axes subparallel to the spreading ridge) in the Indian Ocean as recently observed by Bergman et al. (1984) and Wiens and Stein (1984). The regional stress field along the strike of the Sunda arc varies from compression seaward of and parallel to the Sumatra trench segment, to tension perpendicular to the Java-Flores segment. This explains the selective occurrence of well developed grabens seaward off the Java-Flores segment of the trench, observed by Hilde (1983). Our modelling shows that the observed rotation of the stress field (Denham et al., 1979) in the Australian continent is mainly the consequence of its geographic position relative to the surrounding trench segments and the variations of the forces acting on the down-going slab in each of these. The state of compression in west and central Australia is induced by the action of resistive forces at the Himalayan and Banda arc collision zones. The joint occurrence of high levels of compression in the plate's interior and normal faulting seismicity in the near-ridge areas, is a transient feature unique to the present dynamic situation of the Indo-Australian plate. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

@article{Willett1985,
abstract = {An understanding of the mechanical response of the continental lithosphere to vertical surface loading is crucial when considering geodynamic processes such as intraplate basin formation, postglacial rebound or mountain building. Previous models of the mechanical behaviour of the lithosphere, which are more successful in oceanic than in continental regions, have used specific isotherms to delineate an effectively elastic zone of the lithosphere and result in mathematically convenient descriptions of mechanical behaviour. Heat flow and lithosphere flexure data for continents, however, suggest that this relationship is more complex, which can be demonstrated by numerical modelling of the loading of a heterogeneous visco-elastic lithosphere with temperature-dependent viscosity. Viscous stress relaxation in the lower and hotter section of the lithosphere results in a region of stress concentration dependent on the thermal state of the lithosphere, its structure and the time since loading. Here we present initial numerical models, based on a relatively simple steady-state thermal model constrained by present-day heat flow, which explain observations of continental flexure except in regions which have experienced a long or complex thermal history since loading. {\textcopyright} 1985 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {In the present study, a real nuclear power plant (NPP) outer containment structure has been considered for a safety check and the model has been simulated by Abaqus/implicit software. The Three Mile Island (TMI) containment structure has been taken into consideration for the analysis. The dimension of containment is 54.5 m height (without dome) and 45 m inner diameter. A step-by-step analysis was carried out to evaluate the stresses on the NPP wall due to aircraft crash with induced fire. At starting, the impact load 90 MN was applied to the NPP structure using force history curve of Boeing 707-320 aircraft and the angle of impact was considered as normal to the target. After impact, the nodal temperatures were applied to the model through heat transfer analysis using jet fuel curves due to fuel burning. Lastly, the impact and heat transfer effect were combined to get thermal stress behavior. The time gap between the impact of plane's nose and plane's wing was kept 0.18 s. Heat transfer analysis has been performed after that time because fuel is stored in wings. The most severe region for the effect of fire is upto 10 m height from the foundation because the maximum fuel will flow to the lowermost of structure. The place of impact was assumed at mid-height of cylindrical portion of TMI containment. The concrete damaged plasticity model for concrete material and Johnson–cook model for steel bar has been taken to incorporate the concrete behavior and reinforcement behavior, respectively. For heat transfer and thermal stress analysis, the parameters and properties of the material at different temperatures were taken from Euro-code 2. From the analysis it can be inferred that there was no global damage due to impact, heat as well as thermal stress in the wall, but certain local damage was found on the outside of the wall.},

In this paper, the seismic performance of braced buildings with the BRB outrigger system is investigated to determine the optimal configuration of BRB outrigger, considering the nonlinear SSI effect. For this purpose, the nonlinear dynamic analysis is carried out on four braced buildings with a BRB outrigger system placed on three different soil types. The outrigger configuration changes from first to the top story to capture the seismic performance of different locations of BRB outrigger. It is observed that the outrigger location affects the seismic performance, which is measured in terms of inter-story drift ratio, story displacement, story shear, and energy dissipation capacity. The results are compared to the fixed base condition buildings, which proves considering SSI, shifts the optimal location to the upper story of the structure. Moreover, the effect of soil's stiffness on the seismic responses of structures and the optimal BRB outrigger location is investigated. Finally, the merits of BRB outrigger are shown by comparing its seismic performance that of the conventional outrigger, under frequent, basic, and rare earthquakes. The results show that the optimal locations of different 2-D buildings rested on the dense soil, medium soil, and soft clay are obtained at 0.6, 0.65, and 0.7 of the building's height (H), respectively. Also, the results show that the optimum location of the BRB outrigger system based on the energy dissipation criteria is 0.45H to 0.65H.},

abstract = {Present study addresses the role of major plate-driving forces, particularly the slab pull and slab resistive forces, for the generation of 26 December 2004 Mw {\textgreater} 9.0 off Sumatra megathrust earthquake. Major controls on the plate-driving forces are normally visualized through age, speed, and average dip of the slab during subduction. Wide variation in age, plate obliquity, stress obliquity, subduction rate, dip angle, and flexing depth of the subducting oceanic lithosphere between Andaman and Sumatra thus allowed us for quantitative evaluation of the slab pull (FSP) and slab resistive (FSR) forces in three well-defined sectors (I, II and III). Computed values of these forces in the three sectors: (1) FSP = 1. 29 × 1013 N/m, FSR = 1. 41 × 1013 N/m; sector I, (2) FSP = 2. 10 × 1013 N/m, FSR = 1. 13 × 1013 N/m; sector II, and (3) FSP = 2. 08 × 1013 N/m, FSR = 2. 72 × 1013 N/m; sector III clearly suggest a spatial variation of stress regime in the subducting oceanic lithosphere. Excess FSR in sectors I and III are interpreted as the causative forces behind the triggering of major seismic energy bursts near Sumatra and Andaman on 26 December 2004. A gap of minimum seismic energy burst near Great Nicobar possibly was controlled by the excess of FSP in sector II. This study further advocates that the cyclic stress, resulted from unbalanced component of slab resistive force, had a definite control on the occurrence of 2004 off Sumatra megathrust earthquake around the flexing zone of the subducting lithosphere. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Analysis of the space-time patterns of seismicity in the Himalaya plate boundary has established the existence of three seismic gaps: 1. (1) The "Kashmir gap" lying west of the 1905 Kangra earthquake; 2. (2) the "Central gap", situated between the 1905 Kangra and the 1934 Bihar earthquakes; 3. (3) the "Assam gap" between the 1897 and 1950 Assam earthquakes. This study has shown that the above great earthquakes were preceded as well as followed by long periods (≥ 19 years) of decreased levels of seismic activity in the epicentral regions. Remarkable decrease in the seismicity following the year 1970 has been observed in the western half of the Central gap as well as in the Assam gap. Local seismic investigation in the Assam gap confirms this feature and the seismicity suggests the existence there of an asperity. The local seismic investigations in Garhwal Himalaya have shown that the small earthquakes are confined to the upper 6-8 km of the crust and may have strike-slip motions. These earthquakes occur in a region where teleseismically recorded events were few. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {We have analyzed the differential flow stress during the mylonitization of quartzose rocks in the Ruby Mountains, Nevada, using grain-size piezometers and kinetic laws for grain growth. Quartz grain-size peizometers suggest that the mylonitization occurred under differential stresses ($\sigma$1-$\sigma$3) of 38-64MPa, or maximum shear stresses of 19-32MPa. Extrapolation of quartzite flow laws indicates that the mylonitization occurred at strain rates between 10-10 and 10-13s-1; arguments presented in the paper suggest that the likely range of strain rates is 10-11 to 10-12s-1. These strain rates are compatible with displacement rates of the order of 23mm yr-1 along a 1.5km-thick simple shear zone. -from Authors},

abstract = {A preliminary step to study the geomorphological features or morphometric study of any area is analysis of its relief feature. The variation of earth surface or a part of it becomes focus of a geomorphic study of landforms. The meaning of term relief may be defined as the difference in elevation of any part of the earth's surface or relative vertical inequality of land surface. Relative relief is among the techniques, those are effectively capable of presenting three dimensional relief characteristics with the help of two-dimensional maps, without considering sea level. Relief and other geomorphic elements are also based in differences in elevation. These morphometric elements are absolute relief, relative relief, slope and dissection index, etc. who, help to classify morpho units of terrain. However, in this chapter, elements, that are directly related with relief have been discussed. These elements are known to help in analysis of any landform and also in categorizing landforms into various morphounits and their relation with geology and hydrology of the area. The morphometric elements are relative relief, absolute relief, slope, and dissection index and drainage characteristics. These elements of morphometry are valuable in dividing the landforms into various morphounits and their relation with geology of a particular area, climatic and hydrological conditions as well as classification and sub classification of landforms i.e. absolute relief, slope, relief profile etc.. So, relief analysis becomes essential for studying a given area. Relief also indicates the past geological events occurred in the particular area. In the present study, elements those directly related with relief including relative relief are discussed. The surface of study area has resulted in fragments or remnatal surfaces mainly caused by faulted action of erosion. At a glance, different organic phases of study area such as denudation process have also effected relief features. The whole processes of relief depended upon the nature of relief i.e. young, mature or old, geological condition, climatic condition, rainfall, temperature, humidity, evaporation slope aspect, etc. As far as the relief is a product of a number of factors, therefore a definite class value of relative relief is not suitable for a particular nature of relief. Relief is commonly regarded as the range in altitude (Smith, 1935). This definition is logically right and acceptable. Relief analysis of any terrain may be done with the help of morphometry.

abstract = {The concept of background seismicity is strictly related to the identification of spontaneous and triggered earthquakes. The definition of foreshocks, main shocks and aftershocks is currently based on procedures depending on parameters whose values are notoriously assumed by subjective criteria. We propose a method for recognizing the background and the induced seismicity statistically. Rather than using a binary distinction of the events in these two categories, we prefer to assign to each of them a probability of being independent or triggered. This probability comes from an algorithm based on the ETAS model. A certain degree of subjectivity is still present in this procedure, but it is limited by the possibility of adjusting the free parameters of the algorithm by rigorous statistical criteria such as maximum likelihood. We applied the method to the seismicity of southern California and analyzed the sensitivity of the results to the free parameters in the algorithm. Finally, we show how our statistical declustering algorithm may be used for mapping the background seismicity, or the moment rate in a seismic area. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Physical (mechanical) modeling of continental collision is performed with a 4-layered mantle model. Compositionally distinct layers of hydrocarbons are used to model a lithosphere which consists of two crustal layers (the upper one quasi-brittle, the lower one plastic) and a plastic mantle layer. The lower crustal layer, the "crustal asthenosphere", has a low yield limit. A low-viscosity liquid (water) represents the asthenosphere under the lithosphere. Lateral compression of the model plate by a piston is the driving mechanism of collision. Similarity criteria are satisfied in the modeling. The collisional process was investigated with various boundary conditions and values of the model parameters. The yield limit and the thickness of the "crustal asthenosphere" were varied, as well as the action of the piston on the plate: the force was applied either throughout the plate section, or on its mantle layer only (in the latter case, this layer slipped relative to the upper crust). Hence different results were obtained. A more realistic pattern seems to occur when the yield limit of the crustal asthenosphere is not too small and free sliding of the crustal layers over the mantle lithosphere is not possible. The upper crustal layer then experiences failure in the collision zone and thrusting develops there. Intensive thickening of the lower crust was observed, the mantle layer being subducted like oceanic lithosphere in a subduction zone. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Gravity anomalies across the Indian region depict most of the geological and tectonic domains of the Indian continental lithosphere, which evolved through Archean cratonic nucleation, Proterozoic accretion, Phanerozoic India-Eurasia plate convergence, and modification through many thermal perturbations and rifting. Integrated analysis of gravity and geoid anomalies together with topographic and heat flow data led to deciphering the mechanism of isostatic compensation of topographic and geological loads, lithospheric structure, and composition. This study discusses the nature of gravity (free-air, Bouguer and Isostatic) and geoid anomalies in relation to the topography, geology, and tectonics, and presents a lithospheric density model across the peninsular India and Himalaya. Southern peninsular Indian region shows relatively low Bouguer gravity anomalies compared to the northern region. The mobile belts are generally observed to have relatively higher Bouguer gravity anomalies, e.g., Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt compared to the shield regions. The gravity lows are observed over topographic features like the Western Ghats and Himalaya, while some of the topographic highs like Aravalli show positive gravity anomaly. The Indian Ocean Geoid Low varies from -82 m over Dharwar Craton to -98 m over the Southern Granulite Terrain and finally reaches a significant low of -106 m in the Indian Ocean. Flexural isostatic compensation with variable Effective Elastic Thickness (EET) {\~{}}10 km to 50 km prevails over the stable continental region. The lithospheric thickness varies from 80 km along the coastal region to 120-130 km beneath the Saurashtra Plateau, the Southern Granulite Terrain, and the Eastern Indian Shield, and reaches to more than 200 km under the Himalayan orogenic belt in the north. From Dharwar Craton to Bundelkhand Craton in central India, the lithospheric thickness varies between 160 and 180 km.},

abstract = {A multitude of observations suggest neotectonic deformation in and around India, but its causes and history are unknown. We use a 2 dimensional finite element model with heterogeneous elastic strengths in continental regions to model the regional stress field orientation and relative magnitudes since the Oligocene. The large-scale geological structure of India is embedded in our model by using published outlines of cratons, fold belts and basins, associated with estimates of their relative strengths, enabling the modelling of stress field deflections along interfaces between relatively strong and weak tectonic elements through time. At 33Ma a roughly NNW-SSE oriented band of relatively high maximum horizontal compressive stress (S{\textless}inf{\textgreater}Hmax{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) straddled India's west coast, while India's east coast and the adjacent Wharton Basin were characterized by relatively low intraplate stresses. Between 20Ma and the present growing collisional boundary forces combined with maturing mid-ocean ridge flanks result in the establishment of an arcuate belt with anomalously high intraplate stress that stretches from India to the Wharton Basin, intersecting the continental shelf roughly orthogonally and crossing the 85° East and Ninetyeast ridges. This results in a compressive tectonic regime favouring folding and inversion northeast of the Godavari Graben on India's east coast, as observed in seismic reflection data, whereas no tectonic reactivation is observed on the continental margin further north, closer to the Mahanadi Graben, or further south. Our stress models account for these differences via spatial variations in modelled horizontal stress magnitudes and intersection angles between margin-paralleling pre-existing basement structures and the evolving Neogene stress field. The models further account for fracture zone strike-slip reactivation offshore Sumatra and lithospheric folding along India's west and southeast coast and can be used to estimate the onset of these deformation episodes to at least the Oligocene and Miocene, respectively.},

abstract = {We present a series of three-dimensional numerical models investigating possible thermal and mechanical effects of ridge subduction and slab window migration. Ridge subduction is a fundamental process of plate tectonics, and the geologic manifestations in the overriding lithosphere have been investigated in many convergent margin settings. Many of the geologic effects of slab window migration (e.g., anomalous high-T metamorphism in the forearc, non-arc-like magmatism in the volcanic arc) are explained primarily by the introduction of a region of hot, upwelling asthenospheric mantle in the subduction zone environment. Using end-member boundary conditions and idealized geometries, our models address the thermal and corresponding mechanical manifestations of slab window migration, and our results provide a general agreement with observations from interpreted regions of slab window migration. Our models show that protracted heating in the forearc region should result in protracted high-temperature metamorphism, associated rheologic weakening and strain partitioning and changes in the topographic uplift pattern in regions affected by slab window migration. Although these models are idealized, they do provide valuable insight into the geodynamics of slab window environments and provide a valuable starting point for further exploration. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The Saurashtra peninsula and the Cambay Basin are two important geological regions in this part. Two and half dimensional density models, based on the crustal seismic structure, were generated to establish a relationship between these two regions. These models indicate that the crust is 32-33 km thick in the eastern Saurashtra and the northern part of the Cambay Basin. The shallower crust is in a triangular region formed by the extension of the western limb of the Proterozoic Aravalli trend in Saurashtra, its eastern limb and the Narmada fault in the south. Compared to 36-37 km thick crust to the west and 38-40 km to the east of this region the crust in the above triangular region is uplifted by 4 to 6 km. This uplift took place either after the deposition of Mesozoic sediments or was concon-dtant with the rise of Reunion plume prior to the extrusion of the Deccan volcanics as the region was close to the axis of the plume. {\textcopyright} Geol.

abstract = {For the deviatoric strain-softening associated with static liquefaction to occur in a landslide, the soil must be contractile, be subjected to a monotonic loading trigger, and be sufficiently saturated to permit the generation of excess pore-water pressures upon loading. It is hypothesized in this paper that static liquefaction might preferentially occur in the saturated granular soil located at the base of the landslide in certain circumstances rather than the well-drained inclined portion of the slope. This hypothesis was tested using the technique of geotechnical centrifuge modelling with a loose granular slope, which was brought to failure under a step-wise increase in groundwater flux. The rising pore-water pressures eventually led to a small localized failure at the toe of the slope. This toe failure acted as the monotonic loading trigger to shear the loose contractile saturated sand at the base of the slope and cause liquefaction to occur in the base region.

abstract = {We present finite-element models that investigate the relative importance of both trenchward motion of the upper plate and interplate coupling for the development of topography at convergent margins. Commonly, the role of a trenchward moving continental plate for the growth of topography is neglected in both modelling and field studies. Instead, forces exerted by the downgoing plate on the continental plate as well as interplate coupling are thought to be responsible for the deformation of the upper plate. Our model set-up includes an oceanic plate, which is in contact with a continental plate along a frictional plate interface and driven by slab pull. Both lithospheres have an elasto-visco-plastic rheology. The models demonstrate that friction along the plate interface can only lead to a high topography if the upper plate is moving toward the trench. Without such a trenchward advance, no high topography is generated, as the upper plate subsides owing to the drag exerted by the subducting plate. Increasing the coefficient of friction only amplifies the drag and increases the amount of subsidence. Our findings imply that trenchward motion of the continental plate plays a key role for the development of mountain belts at convergent margins; subduction of an oceanic plate even with high interplate coupling cannot explain the formation of Andeantype orogens.},

abstract = {Computational fluid-structure interaction is most commonly performed using a partitioned approach. For strongly coupled problems sub-iterations are required, increasing computational time as flow and structure have to be resolved multiple times every time step. Many sub-iteration techniques exist that improve robustness and convergence, although still flow and structure problems have to be solved a number of times every time step. In this paper we apply a multilevel acceleration technique, which is based on the presumed existing multigrid solver for the flow domain, to a two-dimensional strongly coupled laminar and turbulent problem and investigate the combination of multilevel acceleration with the Aitken underrelaxtion technique. It is found that the value for the under-relaxation parameter is not significantly different when performing sub-iterations purely on the coarse level or purely on the fine level. Therefore coarse and fine level sub-iterations are used alternately, where it is found that performing 3 or 4 coarse level sub-iterations followed by 1 fine level sub-iteration resulted in the highest gain in efficiency. Although the total number of sub-iterations increases slightly by 30{\%}, the number of fine grid iterations can be decreased by as much as 65-70{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer.},

Two sets of parameters of Johnson–Cook material model describing material behavior of Al 6061-T6 were investigated by comparing cutting forces and chip morphology. A two-dimensional finite element model was developed and validated with the experimental results published literature. Cutting tests were conducted at low-, medium-, and high-speed cutting speeds. Chip formation and cutting forces were compared with the numerical model. A novel technique of cutting force measurement using power meter was also validated. It was found that the cutting forces decrease at higher cutting speeds as compared to the low and medium cutting speeds. The poor prediction of cutting forces by Johnson–Cook model at higher cutting speeds and feed rates showed the existence of a material behavior that does not exist at lower or medium cutting speeds. Two factors were considered responsible for the change in cutting forces at higher cutting speeds: change in coefficient of friction and thermal softening. The results obtained through numerical investigations after incorporated changes in coefficient of friction showed a good agreement with the experimental results.},

abstract = {To investigate the settlement response, load transfer behavior, and geometric effect of noncircular piles, a general three-dimensional (3D) analytical continuum model for axially loaded noncircular pile-multilayered homogeneous soil systems is presented. In the analysis, both the vertical and horizontal soil displacement fields are considered, and the variations of the soil displacement components are described by the three displacement transfer functions along the x, y, and z directions. The governing differential equations of noncircular piles and soil are derived by applying the principle minimum potential energy and variational method to the pile-soil system. A complex variable function conformal mapping technique is introduced to overcome the complex boundary conditions of the transfer functions. Then, the numerical solutions of all the governing differential equations are simultaneously solved following an iterative algorithm. The reliability of this approach is validated by comparing some pile and soil responses with the results from existing analytical solutions or a rigorous finite element analysis. Differences in the settlement response and the axial force distribution between noncircular and circular piles are observed. In addition, the pile shaft resistance along the perimeter of the cross-sections shows that a greater load is required in order to fully mobilize the ultimate resistance of the noncircular piles. We also compare the stress ((Formula presented.)) contours of some typical noncircular piles with a circular pile, which provides useful insights into the geometric effect.},

A few boundaries are newly interpreted from topography, volcanism, and/or seismicity, taking into account relative plate velocities from magnetic anomalies, moment tensor solutions, and/or geodesy. In addition to the 14 large plates whose motion was described by the NUVEL-1A poles (Africa, Antarctica, Arabia, Australia, Caribbean, Cocos, Eurasia, India, Juan de Fuca, Nazca, North America, Pacific, Philippine Sea, South America), model PB2002 includes 38 small plates (Okhotsk, Amur, Yangtze, Okinawa, Sunda, Burma, Molucca Sea, Banda Sea, Timor, Birds Head, Maoke, Caroline, Mariana, North Bismarck, Manus, South Bismarck, Solomon Sea, Woodlark, New Hebrides, Conway Reef, Balmoral Reef, Futuna, Niuafo'ou, Tonga, Kermadec, Rivera, Galapagos, Easter, Juan Fernandez, Panama, North Andes, Altiplano, Shetland, Scotia, Sandwich, Aegean Sea, Anatolia, Somalia), for a total of 52 plates. No attempt is made to divide the Alps-Persia-Tibet mountain belt, the Philippine Islands, the Peruvian Andes, the Sierras Pampeanas, or the California-Nevada zone of dextral transtension into plates; instead, they are designated as "orogens" in which this plate model is not expected to be accurate. The cumulative-number/area distribution for this model follows a power law for plates with areas between 0.002 and 1 steradian. Departure from this scaling at the small-plate end suggests that future work is very likely to define more very small plates within the orogens. The model is presented in four digital files: a set of plate boundary segments; a set of plate outlines; a set of outlines of the orogens; and a table of characteristics of each digitization step along plate boundaries, including estimated relative velocity vector and classification into one of 7 types (continental convergence zone, continental transform fault, continental rift, oceanic spreading ridge, oceanic transform fault, oceanic convergent boundary, subduction zone). Total length, mean velocity, and total rate of area production/destruction are computed for each class; the global rate of area production and destruction is 0.108 m 2/s, which is higher than in previous models because of the incorporation of back-arc spreading. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Yes. Early attempts to determine whether or not earthquake events were Poisson-distributed led to the conclusion that main sequence events were significantly non-Poissonian, whether worldwide catalogs (Aki, 1956), or local catalogs (Knopoff, 1964) were con-sidered. Such a conclusion is of importance in earthquake prediction; a demonstration of nonrandomness in earthquake catalogs gives rise to the hope that a basis for prediction of occurrence times can be found by decoding the sequential message in the list of events. Conversely, if earthquakes are random events in time, no hope exists for finding order in earthquake catalogs and, hence, attempts to predict times of occurrence based on studies of catalog sequences are very likely doomed. Nevertheless, a result which shows that earthquake sequences are Poissonian can be of use in estimating seismic risk (Molchan, et al., 1970) by virtue of the simple statistical models which result; we assume that more complicated statistical models will make the analytical procedures more complicated, although such analyses have not been carried out in detail. Aftershocks are earthquake events which are causally connected with a parent event which is usually large. Typical earthquake catalogs must be non-Poissonian if they are mixtures of two populations, aftershock clusters which are not Poissonian, and main-sequence events which may or may not be. Interest in randomness or nonrandomness of earthquake sequences centers on main-sequence events. Immediately after a large earthquake, numerous aftershocks occur on a short time scale. Later in aftershock sequences, the time interval between earthquakes becomes longer. The clustering property implies short-term predictability. The success of any attempt to study the randomness of main-sequence events depends on the skill with which aftershocks are identified and removed from catalog listings. If this is not done skillfully, the residual is certain to be non-Poissonian. In one of the first attempts to delete aftershocks from an earthquake catalog (Knopoff, 1964), it was found that successively more realistic definitions of aftershocks led to main-sequence catalogs which were successively more Poissonian. Nevertheless, after the best attempt to remove aftershocks was made, a significantly non-Poissonian residual catalog remained. The result of this e{\~{}},rly investigation left the basic question unresolved: Was the non-Poissonian result the consequence of a still incomplete identification of aftershocks, or is there a genuine non-Poissonian character to a catalog of main-sequence earth-quakes (i.e., was the removal of aftershocks the best that could be done)? We describe an empirical method of culling aftershocks from an earthquake catalog, which is an alternative to the earlier (Knopoff, 1964) procedure. The main-sequence list that remains 1363},

abstract = {Complementation of B{\"{u}}chi automata, required for checking automata containment, is of major theoretical and practical interest in formal verification. We consider two recent approaches to complementation. The first is the rank-based approach of Kupferman and Vardi, which operates over a DAG that embodies all runs of the automaton. This approach is based on the observation that the vertices of this DAG can be ranked in a certain way, termed an odd ranking, iff all runs are rejecting. The second is the slice-based approach of K{\"{a}}hler and Wilke. This approach tracks levels of "split trees" - run trees in which only essential information about the history of each run is maintained. While the slice-based construction is conceptually simple, the complementing automata it generates are exponentially larger than those of the recent rank-based construction of Schewe, and it suffers from the difficulty of symbolically encoding levels of split trees. In this work we reformulate the slice-based approach in terms of run DAGs and preorders over states. In doing so, we begin to draw parallels between the rank-based and slice-based approaches. Through deeper analysis of the slice-based approach, we strongly restrict the nondeterminism it generates. We are then able to employ the slice-based approach to provide a new odd ranking, called a retrospective ranking, that is different from the one provided by Kupferman and Vardi. This new ranking allows us to construct a deterministic-in-the-limit rank-based automaton with a highly restricted transition function. Further, by phrasing the slice-based approach in terms of ranks, our approach affords a simple symbolic encoding and achieves the tight bound of Schewe's construction},

The cause and the tectonic implication of this earthquake have been the subject of in-tensive debate. Located {\~{}}400 km from the plate boundary, the Bhuj earthquake bears significant similarities with some intraplate earthquakes such as those in the New Madrid seismic zone in central United States. On the other hand, the plate boundary in western India is known to be diffuse, thus the Bhuj earthquake may reflect broad plate boundary deformation. To investigate the cause of the Bhuj earthquake and numerous other historic earthquakes concentrated in this part of the Indian plate, we have developed a viscoelastic finite element model to simulate the stress state within the lithosphere of western India. Our results indi-cate that the intracontinental thrusting and shearing along the northwestern Indian plate boundary may have caused deviatoric stresses to broadly diffuse into the Indian continent. When the internal rheologic heterogeneities of the Indian plate, such as the inherited mechanical weakening in the Kutch rift basin, is included, the model predicts a broad earthquake-prone zone extending hundreds of kilome-ters into the interior of the Indian plate that includes the Bhuj earthquake and most historic earthquakes in western India.},

In the previous work the regional landslide hazard zonation maps of Srinagar-Rudraprayag area of Garhwal Himalaya in the state of Uttarakhand were prepared using subjective and objective approaches. In the present work the landslide hazard zonation mapping at macro level was carried out in a small area using a Landslide Hazard Evaluation Factor rating scheme. The hazard zonation map produced by using this technique classifies the area into relative hazard classes in which the high hazard zones well correspond with high frequency of landslides. The results of this map when compared with the regional zonation maps prepared earlier show that application of the present technique identified more details of the hazard zones, which are broadly shown in the earlier zonation maps.},

In this paper, the effect of each contributing factor on the global stability of a 3D slope was carefully and comprehensively investigated by making use of a field case. However, the conclusions drawn from these analyses are not specific to a single case study. Using a couple of hundred analyses that were run within the context of this paper, some guidelines were provided and the influence of each factor on the factor of safety was clearly stated. The results indicated that, the influence of plan curvature can be defined with a unique relationship based on the factor of safety of the slope which is itself directly proportional to the radius of curvature of the slope. Considering the case of local loading on top of the slope, the loading distance and the size of the numerical domain on the shape of the failure mechanism were investigated in this paper and these effects could be demonstrated in the light of the results. Moreover, the influence of piles on slope stability was studied not only for the common “no surcharge case”, but also for different loading conditions in order to optimize the effective pile location. The effect of the pile cross-sectional shape was also discussed in order to optimize the CPU time. Thus, the results of this study are intended to reveal some key issues and bring insight into the design processes.},

abstract = {The overall problem of nuclear power plant safety against an accidental aircraft impact is discussed in relation with its structural analysis and design. Associated risks, such as fire, which is a potential source of damage for buildings and other structures, are not considered. The paper is divided in two parts. In part I different approaches used for determining the reaction-time curve are discussed. The influence on the results of target motions is examined next. It is shown that for the evaluation of structural response an aircraft-structure interaction analysis is usually an unnecessary refinement, "mean" reaction-time and impact area-time curves being sufficient to define the excitation. Preliminary results for oblique impact are also given. Since the conditional probability of a normal impact is very small, the consideration of oblique impact may become acceptable in future design criteria. In part II, available solutions for the resulting structural dynamic problem are reviewed. The feasibility of resorting to a static analysis is also discussed. Present practices to evaluate floor response spectra are reviewed next. The short-comings of the "deterministic" approach are pointed out. It is proposed to define the excitation as a mean plus a fluctuating force. The latter is treated as a nonstationary random process and the problem solved by numerical integration in the time domain. Although such solutions get prohibitively expensive when the number of degrees of freedom becomes large, results obtained for simple models may help to clarify which are the important variables of the problem. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The evolution of back-arc basins is tied to the development of the dynamics of the subduction system they are a part of. We present a study of back-arc basins and model their development by implementing 3D time-dependant computer models of subduction including an overriding plate. We define three types of episodicity: pseudo-, quasi- and hyper-episodicity, and find evidence of these in nature. Observations of back-arc basin ages, histories of spreading, quiescence and compression in the overriding plate give us an understanding of the time-development of these subduction zones and back-arc basins. Across the globe today, a number of trenches are advancing-the Izu-Bonin Trench, the Mariana Trench, the Japan Trench, the Java-Sunda Trench and the central portion of the Peru-Chile Trench (the Andes subduction zone). The Izu-Bonin, Mariana and Japan all have established back-arc basins, while the others have documented episodes of spreading, quiescence, compression or a combination of these. The combination of advancing and retreating trench motion places these subduction zones in the category of hyper-episodicity. Quasi-episodicity, in which the back-arc shifts between phases of rifting, spreading and quiescence, is the dominant form of episodic back-arc development in the present. We find this type of episodicity in models for which the system is dynamically consistent-that we have allowed the subducting plate's velocity to be determined by the sinking slabs' buoyancy. Quasi- and hyper-episodicity are only found in subduction zones with relatively high subducting plate velocities, between 6 and 9 cm/year. Finally, those subduction zones for which the subducting plate is moving slowly, such as in the Mediterranean or the Scotia Sea, experience only pseudo-episodicity, where the spreading moves linearly towards the trench but often does so in discrete ridge-jump events. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A continuous kinematic model of present-day plate motions is developed which (1) provides more realistic models of plate shapes than employed in the original work of Bercovici {\&} Wessel (1994), and (2) provides a means whereby geophysical data on intraplate deformation is used to estimate plate-margin widths for all plates. A given plate's shape function (which is unity within the plate and zero outside the plate) can be represented by analytic functions as long as the distance from a point inside the plate to the plate's boundary can be expressed as a single-valued function of azimuth (i.e. a single-valued polar function). To allow sufficient realism to the plate boundaries, without the excessive smoothing used by Bercovici {\&} Wessel, the plates are divided along pseudo-boundaries; the boundaries of plate sections are then simple enough to be modelled as single-valued polar functions. Moreover, the pseudo-boundaries have little or no effect on the final results. The plate shape function for each plate also includes a plate-margin function which can be constrained by geophysical data on intraplate deformation. We demonstrate how this margin function can be determined by using, as an example data set, the global seismicity distribution for shallow (depths less than 29 km) earthquakes of magnitude greater than 4. Robust estimation techniques are used to determine the width of seismicity distributions along plate boundaries; these widths are then turned into plate-margin functions, that is analytic functions of the azimuthal polar coordinate (the same azimuth-of which the distance to the plate boundary is a single-valued function). The model is used to investigate the effects of 'realistic' finite-margin widths on the Earth's present-day vorticity (i.e. strike-slip shear) and divergence fields as well as the kinetic energies of the toroidal (strike-slip and spin) and poloidal (divergent and convergent) flow fields. The divergence and vorticity fields are far more well defined than for the standard discontinuous plate model and distinctly show the influence of diffuse plate boundaries such as the northeast boundary of the Eurasian plate. The toroidal and poloidal kinetic energies of this model differ only slightly from those of the standard plate model; the differences, however, are systematic and indicate a greater proportion of spin kinetic energy in the continuous plate model.},

abstract = {Mechanical properties of lithosphere are of primary importance for interpretation of deformation at all spatial and time scales, from local scale to large-scale geodynamics and from seismic time scale to billions of years. Depending on loading conditions and time scale, lithosphere exhibits elastic, brittle (plastic) or viscous (ductile) properties. As can be inferred from rock mechanics data, a large part of the long-term lithospheric strength is supported in the ductile or ductile-elastic regime, while it also maintains important brittle strength. Yet, at short seismic time scale (s), the entire lithosphere responds in elastic/brittle-elastic regime. Even though rock mechanics experiments provide important insights into the rheological properties of the lithosphere, their conditions (e.g., time scales, strain rates, temperature and loading conditions) are too far from those of real Earth. Therefore, these data cannot be reliably extended to geological time- and spatial scales (strain rates ∼10-17 to 10-13s-1) without additional parameterization or validation based on geological time scale observations of large-scale deformation. For the oceanic lithosphere, the Goetze and Evan's brittle-elastic-ductile yield strength envelopes (YSEs) were validated by geodynamic scale observations such as the observations of plate flexure. However, oceanic lithosphere behavior in subduction zones and passive continental margins is strongly conditioned by the properties of the continental counterpart, whose rheology is less well understood. For continents and continental margins, the uncertainties of available data sources are greater due to the complex structure and history of continental plates. For example, in a common continental rheology model, dubbed "jelly sandwich", the strength mainly resides in crust and mantle, while in some alternative models the mantle is weak and the strength is limited to the upper crust. We address the problems related to lithosphere rheology and mechanics by first reviewing the rock mechanics data, Te (flexure) and Ts (earthquake) data and long-term observations such as folding and subsidence data, and then by examining the physical plausibility of various rheological models. For the latter, we review the results of thermo-mechanical numerical experiments aimed at testing the possible tectonic implications of different rheology models. In particular, it appears that irrespective of the actual crustal strength, the models implying weak mantle are unable to explain either the persistence of mountain ranges for long periods of time or the integrity of the subducting slabs. Although there is certainly no single rheology model for continents, the "jelly sandwich" is a useful first-order model with which to parameterize the long-term strength of the lithosphere. It is concluded that dry olivine rheology laws seem to represent well the long-term behavior of mantle lithosphere in oceans, margins and continents. As to the continent and margin crust rheology, analysis of the results of thermo-mechanical models and of Te data based on the most robust variants of flexural models, suggests that continental plates with Te 30-50{\%} smaller than their theoretical mechanical thickness hm (i.e. Te=20-60km) should be characterized by a weak lower or intermediate crustal rheology enabling mechanical decoupling between crust and mantle. Older plates such as cratons are strong due to crust-mantle coupling and specific properties of the cratonic mantle lithosphere. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {While the surface of Tibet is undergoing pervasive pure shear, stable terranes, straddling subsurface sutures, remain in the sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM), attesting to its strength. Furthermore, sub-horizontal, cohesive remnant of Indian SCLM is traced northward from the Himalayan deformation front for about 600. km, exemplifying the longevity of buoyant, strong SCLM of Archean shields. Bimodal distribution of earthquake depths, with peaks concentrating in the upper/middle crust and near the Moho, has been a longstanding evidence for strong SCLM. Recent results from the Himalayas-Tibet and along the East African rift system not only corroborate the bimodal distribution but also firmly established that large earthquakes occur below the Moho. Intriguingly, non-volcanic tremors-newly discovered mode of elastic strain release-also occur near the Moho but well below the seismogenic zone in the upper/middle crust. Considering recent field observations and laboratory experiments of viscosity contrast across the Moho, the SCLM must be strong enough to accumulate elastic strain, a prerequisite for earthquakes, over geological time. Moreover, under laboratory conditions, recent advances that link the termination of frictional instability, an analogue for earthquakes, and the onset of crystal plasticity, provided a physical basis for limiting temperatures of crustal ({\~{}}. 300-400°C) and mantle ({\~{}}. 600-700°C) earthquakes. While any single rheological model cannot possibly account for all tectonic settings (which also evolve with time), lithological contrast across the Moho is important in shaping the bimodal distribution of strength in the continental lithosphere. {\textcopyright} 2011 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

abstract = {We developed a new 2-D numerical approach to study solid-fluid coupling applied to subduction zones. The lithosphere is characterised by an elastic or elastoplastic behaviour and the asthenosphere by a homogeneous isoviscous fluid. The temperature effects are ignored and viscosity and density are constant in time. The solid and the fluid problem are discretised by the finite elements method (FEM). The same solid code used in Hassani et al. [Hassani, R., Jongmans, D., Chery, J., Study of plate deformation and stress in subduction processes using two-dimensional numerical models, J. Geophys. Res. (1997) 102 17951-17965.] has been used to compute the solution of the solid problem. The Stokes problem is solved by a direct solver with a stabilisation procedure. We used a very simple staggered coupling method where the fluid domain is regularly re-meshing. We observed numerical instabilities when the time step is not sufficiently small, especially when strong coupling between the solid and the fluid occurs. We have tested different configurations where the lithosphere is elastic or elastoplastic and show how the slab geometry, the topography and the stress regime in the plates are affected by the viscous resistance of the mantle. We observed that the asthenosphere viscosity is a fundamental parameter in the subduction process. For subduction with an extensional regime in the upper plate, we observe a linear decrease of the extensional stress as a function of the asthenospheric viscosity. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The complete Bouguer anomaly map of the region encompassing Central Indian Shear Zone is characterised by a broad relative gravity high over Central Indian Tectonic Zone as compared to the Bastar Craton. The paired gravity anomaly across the two crustal domains signifies that the Central Indian Shear Zone is a locus of density discontinuity along which the two crustal domains accreted. Horizontal gravity gradient analysis further demonstrates the northward subduction of the Bastar Craton beneath the Bundelkhand Craton. 21/2D gravity modelling along Mungwani-Rajnandgaon profile, constrained by Seoni-Kalimati seismic section, delineates a thick crust beneath the Bastar Craton as compared to the Central Indian Tectonic Zone. Northward dipping contact of the two crustal domains when projected on the surface coincides with the Central Indian Shear Zone. With a well defined Moho offset and crustal density discontinuity, Central Indian Shear Zone represents a suture zone that separates the Bastar Craton from the Central Indian Tectonic Zone. A low-velocity (6.4km/s)/density (2.90g/cm3) layer at the base of the crust and relatively lower density (3.21g/cm3) subcrustal mantle may be the imprint of thermal remobilization beneath the Central Indian Tectonic Zone. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Semidefinite programming (SDP) provides a convenient framework for the solution of optimization problems involving the eigenvalues of symmetric matrices. The classical Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion for an isotropic cohesive-frictional continuum is most naturally expressed in terms of principal stresses (eigenvalues of the symmetric stress tensor), while the associated flow rule and plastic dissipation function can both be expressed in terms of principal strains (eigenvalues of the symmetric strain tensor). This suggests that SDP could be suitable for performing limit analysis of three-dimensional (3D) structures obeying the Mohr-Coulomb criterion, where the yield and flow rule constraints are difficult to enforce using other methods of optimization. In this paper it is demonstrated that SDP can indeed be used to obtain both lower and upper bounds on the exact collapse load for a Mohr-Coulomb continuum in 3D, though a novel derivation is needed to arrive at an efficient SDP formulation of the upper bound in terms of kinematic quantities only. Two numerical examples are studied, using finite-element discretizations of the stress and displacement fields that preserve the strictness of the lower and upper bound solutions. The arising optimization problems are solved using the general-purpose SDP solver SeDuMi, with no attempt to modify or tailor the code for this specific application. Even so, 3D analyses of moderate size (several thousand tetrahedral elements) are handled with encouraging efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2008 ASCE.},

The "GPS Triangle Strain Calculator" (Excel and Matlab versions) takes the velocity at each of the three GPS stations, and determines what types of transformations the region between them is undergoing. It breaks the total measured GPS velocities into components of the different types of transformations-translation, rotation, extension, and strain. • The Translation Vector can be visualized as the vector from one specific point to another-from the original position of the center of the triangle formed by the three GPS sites to the displaced position of the center of the triangle. o The East component of the translation vector is computed by taking the average of the three E (east-west) velocity vectors, expressed in meters per year (1 m/yr = 1000 mm/yr; 1 mm/yr = 0.001 m/yr). A negative value signifies westward movement. o In a similar way, the N component of the translation vector is the average of the N (north-south) velocity vectors, also expressed in meters per year; negative value is southward movement. o The Azimuth of the translation is the average direction that the GPS sites are moving. The azimuth is measured in a horizontal plane, starting at north (0° azimuth) and rotating around in a clockwise direction. So, for example, a translation vector that is pointing due west has an azimuth of 270°. o The speed of the translation vector is the length or magnitude of the vector, expressed in meters per year. This is found using the Pythagorean theorem because the E and N components form a right triangle with the translation vector as the hypotenuse. If E is the E component, and N is the N component, then speed = E 2 + N 2},

abstract = {This paper provides a generic equation for the evaluation of the maximum earthquake magnitude mmax for a given seismogenic zone or entire region. The equation is capable of generating solutions in different forms, depending on the assumptions of the statistical distribution model and/or the available information regarding past seismicity. It includes the cases (i) when earthquake magnitudes are distributed according to the doubly-truncated Gutenberg-Richter relation, (ii) when the empirical magnitude distribution deviates moderately from the Gutenberg-Richter relation, and (iii) when no specific type of magnitude distribution is assumed. Both synthetic, Monte-Carlo simulated seismic event catalogues, and actual data from Southern California, are used to demonstrate the procedures given for the evaluation of mmax. The three estimates of mmax for Southern California, obtained by the three procedures mentioned above, are respectively: 8.32 ± 0.43, 8.31 ± 0.42 and 8.34 ± 0.45. All three estimates are nearly identical, although higher than the value 7.99 obtained by Field et al. (1999). In general, since the third procedure is non-parametric and does not require specification of the functional form of the magnitude distribution, its estimate of the maximum earthquake magnitude mmax is considered more reliable than the other two which are based on the Gutenberg-Richter relation.},

abstract = {We report the results of the South Indian Strain Measuring Experiment (SISME) designed to determine whether strain related to mieroseismicity in the past century may have deformed the networks of the 19th century Great Trigonometrical Survey of India (GTS). More than a dozen GTS points were measured between Mangalore, Madras, and Kanyakumari in southernmost India using GPS geodesy to determine regional deformation. Detailed measure- ments were made near two oftbe original baselines of the survey to determine the reliability of dilatational strain data for the network. The regional measurements r{\~{}}wealed negligible regional dilatational (+ 11"2 + 10 microstrain) and shear strain changes (0-66 + l'2{\#}radians) in the southernmost 530 km of India. In addition to these measurements, we determined the rate of northward and eastward motion of a point in Bangalore (1991-1994) in the ITRF92 reference frame to be 39 + 3-5 ram/year, and 51{\_} 11 mm/year respectively. This is consistent with NUVEL-1A plate motion estimate for India. Simultaneous measurements to a point near Kathmandu reveal that the Indian plate and the Southern Himalaya are moving approximate- ly in unison, placing an upper limit on the rate of creep processes beneath the lesser Himalaya of {\~{}} 6mm/year, and suggesting relatively rigid behavior of the Indian plate north of Bangalore. The stability of the Indian plate is confirmed by the absence of sight,ant changes in the lengths of the two baselines at Bangaiore and Cape Comorin, which, within the limits of experimental error have not changed since 1869. The measurements place an{\~{}}upper limit for recent deformation in the southern peninsula, and hence a lower limit for the {\~{}}al time for intraplate earthquakes in the region of approximately 10,000 years, assuming shear failure strain of approximately 100{\#}radians. This, in turn, implies that recurrence intervals for Peninsular Earthquakes far exceed the length of the written historic record, suggesting that the characterisation of seismic recurrence intervals from historical studies is likely to be fruitless. rn contrast, the SISME experiment demonstrates that the noise level of geodetic studies based on 19th century GTS data is less than 0-02 gstrain/year, providing considerable scope for delineating regions of anomalously high seismogenic strain, by GPS measurements at all available trig points of the 19th century GTS survey.

The receiver function analysis of the primary and reverberated phases allowed us to image the down going Moho beneath the Burmese micro plate parallel to the subducting slab. We observed that this subduction zone is characterized by sharp dip of a thick (˜45 km) crust in the Indian Territory, which steeply bends down to ˜57 km in the Burmese Territory separated by the Churachandpur Mao Fault (CMF). The Imphal valley, located in the central part of the IBR, has a sedimentary thickness of 2.5 km. The Poisson's ratio values correlate well with the tectonic units comprises the subduction region. We observed high Poisson's ratio values throughout the region, which reflects bulk mafic to ultramafic crustal composition. Our observations of Poisson's ratio beneath the IBR reveal that the Indian crust along the IBR is oceanic in nature, which is possibly the Tethyan oceanic crust of Southeast Asia.},

In order to study the mechanism of these translational rock slides, conventional triaxial tests and creep tests on sandstone specimens from red Jurassic strata in Wanzhou are performed, and the rheological properties of the sandstone at accelerating creep stage are discussed. The quasistatic Nishihara model for transient and steady-state creep is modified by adding a straintriggered inertial element in series, resulting in a phase of quadratic accelerating creep. The model fits the experimental data at all stages of creep, allowing its parameters to be inferred from the data. Finally, a sensitivity study for the analytical solution of the proposed model is carried out, showing the effects of the inertial element and stress level on the creep strain of sandstone. ?

In the more distal part of the peripheral Gangetic foreland basin, the Late Quaternary sedimentary architecture analysis from 17 stratigraphic successions together with optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL) divulge interaction of peripheral bulge tectonics and climate over the past {\~{}}100 kyr. These sections exhibit three sedimentary packages formed under different environmental conditions. Detailed vertical and lateral sedimentary architecture delineates nine lithofacies that are grouped into three facies associations, (i) flood plain facies association, (ii) channel facies association, and (iii) interfluve facies association. The basal package-I, {\textgreater}114 ka old, was deposited by sandy meandering channels and overlying to this with a hiatus of {\~{}}30 ka is package-II, {\~{}}80–54 ka, deposited by gravelly rivers. The sediments of both the packages-I, II are derived from rocks exposed in the peripheral bulge region. Overlain package- III, deposited by small meandering channels, consist of the sediments derived from the Himalaya. The results indicate that the duration of 80–54 ka was a period of forebulge uplift when gravelly fans prograded basinward. Below the fan sediments lies a peripheral bulge unconformity marked by regionally significant pedogenic horizon. This pedogenic horizon qualifies as to be termed as peripheral bulge uncomformity. After 54 ka, the fine Himalayan sediments onlap the cratonic sediments implying rather a stable forebulge tectonics coupled with fluctuating climatic conditions, occasionally bringing micaceous gray coloured sand-silt of Himalayan origin.},

abstract = {In this paper, a MATLAB code is developed to carry out the liquefaction analysis using a simplified and ground response analysis (GRA) approach. For the GRA approach, linear, equivalent linear and Mohr-Coulomb (MC) soil models are incorporated in the code. For the equivalent linear soil model, modulus reduction and damping curve are used, while in the MC model, the plasticity of soil is utilised using the c and friction anglestrength parameters. In order to validate the MATLAB code for the GRA approach, DEEPSOIL (set as a benchmark) results are compared in terms of amplification factor, strain transfer function, acceleration time history, strain time history and response spectrum. It is found that MATLAB code yields the exact results as those by DEEPSOIL. The amplification factor for the MC model is higher as compared to the linear model of soil, and the MC model shifts the predominant frequency of each borehole on the lower side. The Guwahati region is taken as a case study to show the application of the developed MATLAB code. The investigation is carried out at the five locations of the borehole. The cyclic stress is examined using the simplified and ground response analysis caused by the earthquake motion, which is further used in the calculation of the factor of safety. The factor of safety against the liquefaction is calculated at a regular interval of depth at five boreholes using the simplified and GRA approach. It is observed that the average FOS using the simplified approach is higher as compared to GRA (equivalent linear and MC soil model) approach. At all the boreholes, the FOS is less than unity, which shows a higher probability of liquefaction potential.},

This study develops a constitutive model, an integration algorithm, and consistent tangent operators for a piecewise Drucker-Prager (PDP) model. The constitutive model with considering strain hardening with yield flows is derived. The integration algorithm is developed based on return mapping (to smooth portion, apex and corner). The consistent tangent operators are established for each return mapping case. The PDP model is then implemented in commercial finite element code (using Abaqus) by developing a user material subroutine (UMAT). This UMAT is verified for bilinear and extended DP models through finite element analysis (FEA) of a hydrostatic test with a single element. We expect that the UMAT for the PDP model can be used to describe the plastic behavior of pressure-dependent materials accurately.},

In this article, the authors mainly summarize the three seismic probings to discuss the Moho depth of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau based on the previous summaries. The result shows that the Moho of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau is very complex and its depth is very different; the whole outline of it is that the Moho depth is deeper beneath the south than the north and deeper in the west than in the east. In the Qiangtang terrane, the hinterland of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, the Moho is shallower than both the southern and the northern sides. The deepest Moho is 40 km deeper than the shallowest Moho.

abstract = {Despite a long research history over the past 150 years, the geometry, kinematics, and dynamic evolution of the Himalayan orogen remain poorly understood. This is mainly due to continued emphasis on the two-dimensionality of the Himalayan orogenic architecture and extrapolation of geologic relationships from a few well-studied but small areas to the rest of the orogen. Confusion and misconception are also widespread in the Himalayan literature in terms of the geographic, stratigraphic, and structural divisions. To clarify these issues and to provide a new platform for those who are interested in studying the geologic development of this spectacular mountain belt, I systematically review the essential observations relevant to the along-strike variation of the Himalayan geologic framework and its role in Cenozoic Himalayan exhumation, metamorphism and foreland sedimentation. A main focus of my synthesis is to elucidate the emplacement history of the high-grade Greater Himalayan Crystalline Complex (GHC) that occupies the core of the orogen. Because the north-dipping Main Central Thrust (MCT) above and South Tibet Detachment (STD) below bound the GHC in most parts of the Himalaya, it is critical to determine the relationship between them in map and cross-section views. The exposed map pattern in the central Himalaya (i.e., Nepal) indicates that the MCT has a flat-ramp geometry. The thrust flat in the south carries a 2-15-km-thick slab of the GHC over the Lesser Himalayan Sequence (LHS) and creates a large hanging-wall fault-bend fold continuing {\textgreater} 100 km south of the MCT ramp zone. In the western Himalayan orogen at the longitude ∼ 77°E, the MCT exhibits a major lateral ramp (the Mandi ramp). West of this ramp, the MCT places the low-grade Tethyan Himalayan Sequence (THS) over the low-grade LHS, whereas east of the ramp, the MCT places the high-grade GHC over the low-grade LHS. This along-strike change in stratigraphic juxtaposition and metamorphic grade across the MCT indicates a westward decrease in its slip magnitude, possibly a result of a westward decrease in total crustal shortening along the Himalayan orogen. Everywhere exposed, the STD follows roughly the same stratigraphic horizon at the base of the THS, exhibiting a long ({\textgreater} 100 km) hanging-wall flat. This relationship suggests that the STD may have initiated along a preexisting lithologic contact or the subhorizontal brittle-ductile transition zone in the middle crust. Although the STD has the THS in its hanging wall everywhere in the Himalayan orogen, no THS footwall cutoffs have been identified. This has made slip estimates of the STD exceedingly difficult. The southernmost trace of the STD either merges with the MCT (e.g., in Zanskar) or lies within 1-2 km of the MCT frontal trace (e.g., in Bhutan), suggesting that the MCT may join the STD in their up-dip directions to the south. This geometry, largely neglected by the existing models, has important implications for the deformation, exhumation, and sedimentation history of the entire Himalayan orogen. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Earthquakes in India are caused by the release of elastic strain energy created and replenished by the stresses resulting from India's collision with Asia. Accumulating strain distorts the surface of the Indian plate, which despite its slow development can now be detected using precision geodesy. The largest and most severe earthquakes occur on the boundaries of the Indian plate to the east, north and west of the subcontinent. Historically, these areas have been somewhat neglected by precise geodesy and it is only recently that suitably dense networks capable of spanning entire plate boundaries have been developed. Earthquakes within the subcontinent, though devastating, have also remained unserved by historical geodesy in India because the rupture areas of these events are small and have tended to occur between networks of adequate precision. Since 1990, the widespread availability of GPS geodesy has resulted in a number of significant findings related to the translation, deformation and rotation of the Indian plate, and to deformation of its margins. The next decade is likely to see the uncertainties of these estimates fall by a factor of 4, permitting estimates of changes of rate in space and time. We discuss these new findings and their historical antecedents, and identify current trends in seismogeodetic research that are likely to contribute to a new understanding of future Indian earthquakes.},

abstract = {We have developed a 3-D spherical finite-element model to study the dynamic response to surface loads of a self-gravitating and incompressible Earth with 3-D viscoelastic structure. We have forced our model with the ICE-3G deglaciation history of Tushingham and Peltier to study the effects of laterally varying lithospheric thickness on observations of post-glacial rebound (PGR). The laterally varying lithospheric thicknesses are derived from estimates of the thermal structure of the oceanic lithosphere and from elastic thicknesses on continents as estimated from studies of long-term geological loads. Our calculations show that the effects of lithospheric structure on the relative sea level change (RSLC) depend on the locations of the observation sites and on the size of loads. The RSLC at the centre of the North American ice sheet is significantly less sensitive to lithospheric thickness, compared with the RSLC at the centre of the Fennoscandian ice sheet. At the peripheral bulges the RSLC tends to be more sensitive to lithospheric thickness. The RSLC is controlled by local lithospheric thickness. The RSLC at a given location, as predicted using models with laterally varying lithospheric thickness, can be reproduced using a 1-D model with a uniform lithospheric thickness equal to the local lithospheric thickness. Coupled with efficient parallel computing, we believe that the finite-element model that we present here can be used to address a variety of viscoelastic deformation problems in geodynamics.},

abstract = {The Saurashtra Peninsula in northwest India, lying at the northern boundary of the Deccan Volcanic Province, is almost entirely covered by these volcanics. Analogue seismic refraction/wide-angle reflection data along a 160 km long profile, from Navibandar to Amreli, were collected during 1977 to determine the crustal configuration. Reprocessing of these data, after digitization, has yielded a crustal model that is significantly different from the earlier model of Kaila et al. The model shows the upper crust down to a depth of 16 km in the west and 13 km in the east and underplating (velocity of 7.20 km s-1) of the lower crust. The Moho is at a depth of ∼36 km in the western part and at 32-33 km in the eastern part; the change of depth is quite sharp almost in the middle of the profile. Similar depth changes are seen in other crustal horizons indicating a deep fault that is in line with the extension of the Proterozoic Aravalli trend in to the Saurashtra Peninsula. The crustal structure in the eastern part is similar to that in the Cambay Basin and indicates that the crust to the east of the proposed fault is uplifted. The uplifted region extends as far as another arm of the Aravalli trend that turns eastwards. Crustal underplating in large parts of western India is confined to the corridors affected by the passage of India over the R{\'{e}}union Plume in the Late Cretaceous. The shallower Moho appears to be confined to the areas close to the axis (trace of the plume) on Earth's surface of the plume. {\textcopyright} 2004 RAS.},

The distribution regime of displacements in the vertical and horizontal directions, and the vertical strains within the specimen cross-sectional area, were obtained and interpreted. The effect of a surcharge on these variables was also investigated.

abstract = {The aim of this book is to provide the student of Japanese with a simple method for correlating the writing and the meaning of Japanese characters in such a way as to make them both easy to remember. It is intended not only for the beginner, but also for the more advanced student looking for some relief from the constant frustration of how to write the kanji and some way to systematize what he or she already knows. The author begins with writing because--contrary to first impressions--it is in fact the simpler of the two. He abandons the traditional method of ordering the kanji according to their frequency of use and organizes them according to their component parts or "primitive elements." Assigning each of these parts a distinct meaning with its own distinct image, the student is led to harness the powers of "imaginative memory" to learn the various combinations that result. In addition, each kanji is given its own key word to represent the meaning, or one of the principal meanings, of that character. These key words provide the setting for a particular kanji's "story," whose protagonists are the primitive elements. In this way, students are able to complete in a few short months a task that would otherwise take years. Armed with the same skills as Chinese or Korean students, who know the meaning and writing of the kanji but not their pronunciation in Japanese, they are now in a much better position to learn to read (which is treated in a separate volume).

@article{Royden2006,
abstract = {A semi-analytic, 3-D model for subduction within a Newtonian viscous upper mantle provides a dynamically consistent means of computing viscous stress, trench motion and slab geometry in subduction systems. Although negative slab buoyancy provides the basic driving force for subduction, slabs that extend from the surface to the base of the upper mantle are oversupported by viscous stresses in the shallow ({\textless}100–150 km) mantle and undersupported by viscous stresses at greater depth in the upper mantle. These deeper parts of the subduction system act as an 'engine' for subduction while shallower parts act as a 'brake' on trench motion; trench migration rates and slab geometry reflect a competition between these two effects. During steady-state subduction, trench migration rates vary approximately linearly with slab buoyancy and model rates of trench motion are in good agreement with the range of observed rates for a two layer upper mantle viscosity of 2 × 1020 Pa s above 300 km and 5 × 1020 Pa s below. Steady-state slab dip increases as slab density decreases, especially for very low-density slabs, which dip significantly more steeply than high-density slabs. The horizontal velocity at the top of the lower mantle, measured relative to the foreland, has a very large effect on trench migration rates, rivalling or even exceeding that of slab buoyancy. Slab width, parallel to the trench, also has a significant effect on trench migration rates due to the viscous pressure of toroidal flow around the slab. The stiffness of the subducting lithosphere does not exert a significant effect on trench migration rates or slab geometries for rigidities compatible with oceanic lithosphere. Very stiff slabs, with elastic plate thicknesses more that 40 km or viscosities in the range of 1025–1026 Pa s, subduct significantly more slowly than weak slabs, with trench migration rates in the range of half to a third that of weak slabs. Large, unexpected effects on trench migration rates and slab geometry are exerted by the structure and density of the frontal prism and overriding plate, indicating that local geology can exert important constraints on slab dynamics. During non-steady-state subduction, rates of trench migration respond rapidly as variably buoyant lithosphere penetrates into the asthenosphere. In the absence of other driving forces for convergence, trench migration rates can change by a factor of two or more in as little as 2–3 Myr, for example, from 35 to 70 mm yr1 when an oceanic piece of slab follows a continental one into the subduction system. Subduction of variable-buoyancy lithosphere is accompanied by changes in slab dip with depth and through time.},

abstract = {Abstract Darley Dale and Pennant sandstones were tested under conditions of both axisymmetric shortening and extension normal to bedding. These are the two extremes of loading under polyaxial stress conditions. Failure under generalized stress conditions can be predicted from the Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion under axisymmetric compression conditions provided the best form of polyaxial failure criterion is known. The sandstone data are best reconciled using the Mogi (1967) empirical criterion. Fault plane orientations produced vary greatly with respect to the maximum compression direction in the two loading configurations. The normals to the Mohr–Coulomb failure envelopes do not predict the orientations of the fault planes eventually produced. Frictional sliding on variously inclined sawcuts and failure surfaces produced in intact rock samples was also investigated. Friction coefficient is not affected by fault plane orientation in a given loading configuration, but friction coefficients in extension were systematically lower than in compression for both rock types and could be reconciled by a variant on the Mogi (1967) failure criterion. Friction data for these and other porous sandstones accord well with the Byerlee (1977) generalization about rock friction being largely independent of rock type. For engineering and geodynamic modelling purposes, the stress-state dependent friction coefficient should be used for sandstones, but it is not known to what extent this might apply to other rock types.},

abstract = {The Vale of Kashmir is one of the most popular tourist destinations in India. Nestled between the imposing Pir Panjal Range and the towering Karakoram Ranges, the bowl-shaped intermontane valley is studded with numerous freshwater lakes and green meadows. The Jhelum River meanders through the 135 km long valley and exits the oval-shaped basin through a deep gorge near Baramula. The valley preserves a unique landscape known as Karewa. These thick lacustrine and fluvial deposits, capped by loess, form high terrace-like features and cover nearly half the valley. The floodplain of the Jhelum River and the multiple lakes constitute the remaining part of the valley. It is generally agreed that the Kashmir Valley originated from the draining of a huge lake (the Karewa Lake), which was formed as a result of tectonic upheaval and subsequent tectonic uplift of the Pir Panjal and Zanskar Ranges. None of the Karewa deposits provide evidence of glaciers having existed during their deposition within the valley. The uplift of Pir Panjal at {\~{}}4.5 Ma not only triggered the deposition of Karewa sediments in the valley, but the elevated ranges formed an orographic barrier to the incoming southwest monsoon winds and enhanced the dependence of the valley on winter precipitation.},

abstract = {Site response to earthquake loading is one of the fundamental problems in geotechnical earthquake engineering. Most site response analyses assume vertically propagating shear waves in a horizontally layered soil-rock system and simply ignore the effect of site response to vertical earthquake motion, although actual ground motions are comprised of both horizontal and vertical components. In several recent earthquakes very strong vertical ground motions have been recorded, raising great concern over the potential effect of vertical motion on engineering structures. Being a step toward addressing this concern, this paper presents a simple and practical procedure for analysis of site response to both horizontal and vertical earthquake motions. The procedure involves the use of the dynamic stiffness matrix method and equivalent-linear approach, and is built in the modern MATLAB environment to take full advantages of the matrix operations in MATLAB. The input motions can be specified at the soil-bedrock interface or at a rock outcropping. A detailed assessment of the procedure is given, which shows that the procedure is able to produce acceptable predictions of both vertical and horizontal site responses. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Resistive forces along convergent plate boundaries have a major impact on surface deformation, most visibly at collisional plate boundaries. Although quantification of these forces is key to understanding the evolution and present state of mountain belts, they remain highly uncertain due to the complexity of plate boundary structures and rheologies. In previous studies of the Eurasian Plate, we have analysed the balance of plate boundary forces, tractions resulting from lithosphere-mantle coupling, and intraplate variations in topography and density structure. This yielded a range of acceptable force distributions. In this study, we investigate to which extent the observed present-day stress field provides further constraints on the distribution of forces. We address the dynamics of the Eurasian Plate as a whole. This enables us to base our analysis on mechanical equilibrium of a tectonic plate and to evaluate all forces as part of an internally consistent set of forces driving and deforming Eurasia.We incorporate tractions from convective mantle flow modelling in a lithospheric model in which edge and lithospheric body forces are modelled explicitly and compute resulting stresses in a homogeneous elastic thin shell. Intraplate stress observations used are from theWorld StressMap project. Eurasia's stress field turns out to be particularly sensitive to the distribution of collision forces on the plate's southern margin and, to a much lesser extent, to lithospheric density structure and tractions from mantle flow. Stress observations require collision forces on the India-Eurasia boundary of 7.0-10.5 TNm-1 and on the Arabia-Eurasia boundary of 1.3-2.7 TNm-1. Implication of mechanical equilibrium of the plate is that forces on the contacts with the African and Australian plates amount to 1.0-2.5 and 0-1.3 TNm-1, respectively. We use our results to assess the validity of the classical view that the mean elevation of an orogenic plateau can be taken as a measure of the magnitude of the compressive (in this case: collision-related) forces involved. For both the Tibetan and the Iranian plateaus, two plateaus with significantly different average elevations, we find that the horizontal force derived from the excess gravitational potential energy (collapse force) is in balance with the collision force. ?

abstract = {The Alternative Load Path (ALP) method is widely used to assess progressive collapse resistance of steel framed structures. Code-based ALP is threat-independent methodology, implicitly focuses on a very special triggering event, i.e., a small near-field blast, that can lead to complete and sudden column loss. However, in a real blast-induced progressive collapse scenario, characteristics of the triggering event and subsequent initial damage control the structural response. To study these effects, a wide numerical investigation is carried out. First, the code-based ALP method is applied to assess the threat-independent dynamic column removal responses. The results emphasize the importance of initial damage location and building's size. Then, the model structures were analyzed in different blast scenarios. A meaningful difference in the obtained results compared with code-based ALP is observed in both quantity and quality. Finally, a novel methodology (modified ALP) is suggested to update the code-based ALP method to capture the threat-dependent parameters, i.e., column removal time (CRT) and damage level. To serve this purpose, a substructure techniques, i.e., equivalent column model, is developed and validated. The results of three methods (threat-independent code-based ALP, threat-dependent blast analysis (BA) and the proposed modified ALP) are compared, and it is observed that the modified ALP method can effectively adjust the dynamic column removal response to reflect the blast effects.},

abstract = {Observations of relative motion in a geodetic network in Ladakh, India, and across southern Tibet indicate slow shear on the Karakorum fault, rapid east-west extension across the whole of southern Tibet, and constant arc-normal convergence between India and southern Tibet along the Himalayan arc. Measurements of ten campaign-style and six permanent sites with global positioning system (GPS) precise geodesy provide these bounds on the style and rates of the large-scale deformation in the Tibet-Himalaya region. Divergence between sites at Leh, Ladakh, India, and Shiquanhe, western Tibet, as well as slow relative motion among sites within the Ladakh network, limit right-lateral slip parallel to the Karakorum fault to only 3.4 ± 5 mm/yr. This low rate concurs with a recent estimate of 3-4 mm/yr for Late Holocene time, but disagrees with the much higher rate of 30-35 mm/yr that has been used to argue for plate-like behavior of the Tibetan Plateau. Convergence between Ladakh and the Indian subcontinent at 18.8 ± 3 mm/yr at 224° ± 17° (1$\sigma$) differs little from estimates of convergence across the central segment of the Himalaya. Finally, lengthening of the baseline between Leh, Ladakh, and Lhasa (in southeastern Tibet) at 17.8 ± 1 mm/yr or between Leh and Bayi (farther to the southeast) at 18 ± 3 mm/yr, is consistent with an extrapolation of rates of east-west extension of the Tibetan Plateau based both on shorter GPS baselines (e.g., Lhasa-Simikot) and on diverging slip vectors of earthquakes in the Himalaya. We interpret these results to indicate that Tibet behaves more like a fluid than like a plate. {\textcopyright} 2004 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {The paper computes crustal motions in Alaska by calculating the finite element solution for an elastic spherical shell problem. The method allows the finite element mesh to include faults and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) baseline rates of change. Boundary conditions include Pacific-North American (PA-NA) plate motions. The effects that a range of fault slip constraints and weighting of VLBI rates of change has on the solution are explored. The nonrigid behavior of the finite element solution produces patterns of motion that would not have been expected from rigid block models: strike-slip faults can exist in a continuum that has motion mostly perpendicular to their strikes, and faults can exhibit along-strike differences in magnitudes and directions. -from Authors},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A methodology for landslide susceptibility mapping using an integrated remote sensing and GIS approach is presented. A part of the Darjeeling Himalaya was selected for the model execution. IRS satellite data, topographic maps, field data, and other informative maps were used as inputs to the study. Important terrain factors, contributing to landslide occurrences in the region, were identified and corresponding thematic data layers were generated. These data layers represent the geological, topographical, and hydrological conditions of the terrain. A numerical rating scheme for the factors was developed for spatial data analysis in a GIS. The resulting landslide susceptibility map delineates the area into different zones of four relative susceptibility classes: high, moderate, low, and very low. The susceptibility map was validated by correlating the landslide frequencies of different classes. This has shown a close agreement with the existing field instability condition. The effectiveness of the map was also confirmed by the high statistically significant value of a chi-square test.},

abstract = {Teleseismic data from six broad-band stations on the south Indian shield have been analysed, primarily to examine the differences in the crustal structure between the eastern and western units of the Archaean Dharwar craton. SV receiver functions for these stations have been computed and modelled down to the Moho level in terms of Poisson's ratio and shear wave velocities. Results show that the crust for the entire Dharwar craton is mainly simple, and has a low (about 0.25) Poisson ratio. It is usually thinner and less complex than the adjacent Proterozoic crust. However, the western Dharwar craton crust (thickness ∼41 km) with a gradational Moho boundary, is substantially ({\textgreater}7 km) thicker than its eastern counterpart (thickness ∼34 km). No substantial differences in average crustal S velocities (3.6-3.8 km s-1) were found. The eastern Dharwar crust below the Proterozoic Cuddapah basin was also found to have remained relatively simple and undisturbed. The continental margin to the west of the Dharwar craton appears to have shifted further west off the coast, where a possible west coast fault has down-thrown a continental crustal block under the seas. The crust constituting the Deccan volcanic province in the western Indian shield is found to be similar to that of the eastern Dharwar craton. The crust underneath the neighbouring Godavari graben is significantly different from the Dharwar crust and resembles that of a typical rift-valley.},

abstract = {In Northeast India, three major plates interact along two convergent boundaries: the Himalayas and the Indo-Burma Ranges, which meet at the Assam Syntaxis. To clarify this tectonic interaction and the underlying dynamics, we determine the regional seismotectonic stress from the stress inversion of 285 double couple focal mechanism solutions of earthquakes with an average magnitude of 5. We then compare the reconstructed stress regimes with the available information about geodetically determined relative displacements. North-south compression, in a direction consistent with India-Eurasia convergence, prevails in the whole area from the Eastern Himalayas to the Bengal Basin, through the Shillong-Mikir Massif and the Upper Assam Valley. E-W extension in Tibet is related to this N-S India-Eurasia convergence. Not only does the major N-S compression affect the outer segments of the Indo-Burma Ranges, it also extends into the descending slab of Indian lithosphere below these ranges, although stresses at depth are controlled by bending of the slab beneath the Burmese arc. The existence of widespread N-S compression in the Bengal Basin, far away from the Himalayan front, is compatible with the previously proposed convergence between a Shillong-Mikir-Assam Valley block and the Indian craton. E-W compression inside this block supports the hypothesis of a component of eastward extrusion. Stress inversion of focal mechanism solutions in the Indo-Burma Ranges reveals a complex stress pattern. The Burmese arc and its underlying lithosphere experience nearly arc-perpendicular extension with ESE-WNW trends in the northernmost, NE-trending segment and ENE-WSW trends in the main N-S arc segment. Such extensional stress, documented from many arcs, is likely a response to pull from and bending of the subducting plate. At the same time, the Indo-Burma Ranges are under compression as a result of oblique convergence between the Sunda and Indian plates. The maximum compressive stress rotates from NE-SW across the inner and northern arc to E-W near the Bengal Basin. This rotation is consistent with the deformation partitioning reflected in the rotation of relative displacement vectors, from a SSW-directed Sunda-Burma motion to a WSW-directed Burma-India motion. As a consequence of this partitioning, the major belt-parallel fault zones show a variety of movements across the main N-S arc segment, from right-lateral slip in the inner ranges to oblique reverse-dextral slip in the outer ranges and pure thrusting in the westernmost foreland belt. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Authors, Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2009 RAS.},

We use three-component broadband recordings of 200 teleseismic earthquakes (30° ≤ ∆ ≤ 90°) from a 15 station seismic network that has been operational in the Eastern Indian shield since February 2013. We obtain the thinnest crust of 35 km overlying a thin lithosphere of 78 km, below the region near south Singhbhum shear zone, which could be attributed to the 1.6 Ga plume activity associated with Dalma volcanic. However, the thickest crust of 47 km overlying a thin lithosphere of 81 km is noticed below the region near the Singhbhum granite of 3.6 Ga. This thinning of lithosphere could be attributed to the delamination of lithospheric root due to the Himalayan orogeny with a shortening rate of 2 cm/year. This delamination model in SOC gets further support from the densification of the lower crust, which could result from repeated episodes of basaltic underplating associated with episodes related to Dalma ({\~{}} 1.6 Ga) and Rajmahal ({\~{}} 117 Ma) volcanisms. This led to relatively more mafic, heterogeneous and deformed crustal structure in SOC as well as EGMB (with an average crustal Vs of 4.0 km/s) in comparison to that in CGGT (with an average crustal Vs of 3.9 km/s), as seen through our modeling results. The thickest lithosphere of 100 km is observed in the southwestern SOC as well as northeastern CGGT. We also notice that a sharp and flat Moho in CGGT, which could be attributed to thermal reactivation and large volume melting of the mafic cratonic crust during the late Archean subduction process and associated volcanism episodes. This model gets further support from the estimated 169 km thick lower Vs zone in the upper mantle below CGGT. Our modeling results also support a northward subduction of Archean SOC under the Proterozoic CGGT during 1.0–1.6 Ga, as earlier proposed by the geological age data from the region.},

We describe the history of India-Capricorn convergence from updated estimates of India-Somalia-Capricorn plate rotations and observations derived from seismic reection data. New India-Capricorn plate rotations for the past 20 m.y. are consistent with slow north-south convergence from 18 Ma about a stationary or nearly stationary pole near the eastern edge of the Chagos-Laccadive ridge, simpler than predicted by previous models based on many fewer data. The new rotations suggest that convergence began between 18 and 14 Ma, consistent with marine seismic evidence for an onset of deformation at 15.4-13.9 Ma. They further show that convergence rates doubled at 8 Ma, in agreement with a sharp increase in fault activity at 8-7.5 Ma seen on seismic reection proles. A discrepancy between the total strain estimated from kinematic and seismic reection data can be reconciled if pervasive reverse faulting within the diffuse plate boundary is accompanied by block rotations of 1?-3?. ? 2010 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {The mechanism of instability in granular soils is explained and its requirement as a forerunner to the liquefaction of level or sloping ground is described. Case histories support the observation that it is silty sands that liquefy under static and a majority of earthquake-induced conditions. Recent experiments show that clean sands do not behave similarly to silty sands. Tests on loose, silty sand indicate a "reverse" behavior with respect to confining pressure and this violates the basic assumption that loose, silty sands behave similarly to loose, clean sands. Strong correlations between fines content, compressibility, and liquefaction potential are often found for these soils. A procedure for the analysis and evaluation of static liquefaction of slopes of fine sand and silt, such as submarine slopes, mine tailings, and spoil heaps, is presented. It involves determination of the region of instability in stress space in which potential liquefaction may be initiated and determination of the state of stress in the slope. A method of finding the state of stress is developed to predict the zone of potential liquefaction in simple slopes. Trigger mechanisms for initiation of instability followed by soil liquefaction are reviewed and mechanisms of soil strengthening are discussed.},

The theory to describe the complex thermodynamical behavior of such saturated porous solids has come to certain well-founded conclusions only recently. It is the goal of this paper to show the historical development of the porous media theory, which already started in the eighteenth century, formed in some areas by polemic disputes and tragic events in the lifes of the scientists involved. Furthermore, the current state of the research into this subject is discussed, whereby the state of the development of the material independent basic equations and the constitutive theory is illustrated. For a certain class of models general theorems, such as minimum and maximum problems, are derived and the uniqueness of solutions of boundary value problems is proved.},

The field characteristics of the two major fault zones: Gudur-Cuddapah and the Veldurti-Kalva-Gani fault system that cut across the CB have been re-examined and are re-interpreted as typical of transfer faults, which are generated exclusively by extensional tectonics. The earlier concept that these fault systems form a conjugate set of "Anderson type" causing the 'Cuddapah salient', needs to be reviewed. The widespread extension in the upper crust is manifest in the form of normal faulting of 'listric' type in the Papaghni basin and a 'domino' type in the Nallamalai basin. While extensional tectonics have played a major role in shaping the geometry and kinematics of CB, the intermittent phases of compression seem to have been derived from major shearing events related to Proterozoic collisional processes in the region. A hypothetical crustal-cross section across the CB has been constructed considering the available geological and geophysical data and analogies were drawn from well-studied sedimentary basins of other continents. The presence of low-dipping detachment faults and shear zones in the lower crust, and their possible linkage with the extensional faults in the upper crust have been inferred to explain the evolution of the CB. The fault patterns and kinematic history in conjunction with the crustal architecture strongly suggest that the evolution of CB is genetically related to the Proterozoic collisional processes and associated crustal-scale transpressional tectonics in the basement at the eastern margin. {\textcopyright} GEOL.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Jayalakshmi and Raghukanth. One of the most challenging problems in the estimation of seismic hazard is the ability to quantify seismic activity. Empirical models based on the available earthquake catalogue are often used to obtain activity of source regions. The major limitation with this approach is the lack of sufficient data near a specified source. The non-availability of data poses difficulties in obtaining distribution of earthquakes with large return periods. Such events recur over geological time scales during which tectonic processes, including mantle convection, formation of faults and new plate boundaries, are likely to take place. The availability of geometries of plate boundaries, plate driving forces, lithospheric stress field and GPS measurements has provided numerous insights on the mechanics of tectonic plates. In this article, a 2D finite element model of Indo-Australian plate is developed with the focus of representing seismic activity in India. The effect of large scale geological features including sedimentary basins, fold belts and cratons on the stress field in India is explored in this study. In order to address long term behaviour, the orientation of stress field and tectonic faults of the present Indo-Australian plate are compared with a reconstructed stress field from the early Miocene (20 Ma).},

abstract = {We use finite element modeling to investigate on the stress loading-unloading cycles and earthquakes occurrence in the plate interiors, resulting from the interactions of tectonic plates along their boundary. We model a visco-elasto-plastic plate embedding a single or multiple faults, while the tectonic stress is applied along the plate boundary by an external loading visco-elastic plate, reproducing the tectonic setting of two interacting lithospheres. Because the two plates deform viscously, the timescale of stress accumulation and release on the faults is self-consistently determined, from the boundary to the interiors, and seismic recurrence is an emerging feature. This approach overcomes the constraints on recurrence period imposed by stress (stress-drop) and velocity boundary conditions, while here it is unconstrained. We illustrate emerging macroscopic characteristics of this system, showing that the seismic recurrence period $\tau$ becomes shorter as $\Gamma$ and $\Theta$ decreases, where $\Gamma$=$\eta$I/$\eta$L, the viscosity ratio of the viscosities of the internal fault-embedded to external loading plates, respectively, and $\Theta$=$\sigma$Y/$\sigma$L the stress ratio of the elastic limit of the fault to far-field loading stress. When the system embeds multiple, randomly distributed faults, stress transfer results in recurrence period deviations, however the time-averaged recurrence period of each fault show the same dependence on $\Gamma$ and $\Theta$, illustrating a characteristic collective behavior. The control of these parameters prevails even when initial pre-stress was randomly assigned in terms of the spatial arrangement and orientation on the internal plate, mimicking local fluctuations. Our study shows the relevance of macroscopic rheological properties of tectonic plates on the earthquake occurrence in plate interiors, as opposed to local factors, proposing a viable model for the seismic behavior of continent interiors in the context of large-scale, long-term deformation of interacting tectonic plates.},

abstract = {We have compiled the distribution of active faults and folds in the Himalayan-Tibetan orogen and its immediate surrounding regions into a web-based digital map. The main product of this study is a compilation of active structures that came from those documented in the literature and from our own interpretations based on satellite images and digital topographic data. Our digital tectonic map allows a comparison between the distribution and kinematics of active faults with the distribution and focal mechanisms of earthquakes. The active tectonic map is also compared with the contemporary velocity field, obtained by global positioning system studies, that allows a better assessment of partitioning of decadal strainrate fields across individual active structures that may have taken tens of thousands of years to a million years to develop. The active tectonic map provides a basis to evaluate whether the syncollisional late Cenozoic volcanism in Tibet was spatially related to the distribution and development of the active faults in the same area. These comparisons lead to the following findings: (1) Tibetan earthquakes {\textgreater}M5 correlate well with mappable surface faults; (2) the short-term strain-rate field correlates well with the known kinematics of the active faults and their geologic slip rates; and (3) Tibetan Neogene-Quaternary volcanism is controlled by major strike-slip faults along the plateau margins but has no clear relationship with active faults in the plateau interior. Although not explored in this study, our digital tectonic map and the distribution of Cenozoic volcanism in Tibet can also be used to correlate surface geology with geophysical properties such as seismic velocity variations and shear wave-splitting data across the Himalaya and Tibet. {\textcopyright} 2010 by Geological Society of America.},

Further the paper discusses on the occurrence of ill conditioning due to significance of interface thickness and selection of normal and tangential stiffness during interface modeling. In addition to above, some special interface element (different degree of freedom on top and bottom face of element) in non-linear SSI is also reviewed. Therefore the attention is on advantages and disadvantages of the discussed methods according to their applicability, accuracy and caliber to idealize the superstructure and soil.},

abstract = {The distribution of relocated seismicity and the evolving shape of fracture zones through time in the oceanic crust of the Australian Plate adjacent to the Australia:Pacific plate boundary south of New Zealand are used to constrain the deformation of this region of the Australian Plate, here called the Puysegur Block. Relocated seismicity reveals a broad distribution of earthquakes in the Puysegur Block on both inter- and intraplate structures, including two great (M8+) earthquakes in the region over the past twenty years, one of which occurred over 130 km from the plate boundary. Plate reconstructions from the Late Oligocene through Early-Mid Miocene allow us to determine the undeformed shape of fracture zones in the Puysegur Block, formed during the Paleogene when the plate boundary was dominantly a divergent mid-ocean ridge system. Comparing these reconstructions to the present-day shape of the fracture zones allows us to map the deformation that has occurred within the Puysegur Block since the fracture zones formed. These two sets of independent observations delineate a broad zone of deformation extending {\~{}} 150 km into the plate interior from the Macquarie Ridge Complex, the modern plate boundary structure through the region. The persistence of this deformation through time indicates a link with the evolution of the plate boundary over the past {\~{}} 25 Ma from divergence to translation and subduction of the Australian Plate further north at the Puysegur Trench. We infer that this deformation may be a result of stresses in the Puysegur Block resulting from the impingement of the subducting plate on the thickened lithosphere of southern New Zealand. Such a collision may resist subduction, and if resistance remains substantial, further deformation internal to the Puysegur Block may lead to a southward migration of the Australia:Pacific subduction interface and the capturing of this section of lithosphere onto the Pacific Plate. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The radially averaged power spectrum analysis suggests three interfaces and the DEXP method indicates presence of a horizontal cylindrical source below the DFB. The 3D structural inversion shows depth variation from 39 to 46 km in the study region and presence of an upwarp below the DFB and Sandmata complex.

The transverse structure of DFB is absent beneath Gangetic alluvium and show notable westward deflection in line with the NW-SE trending Delhi-Sargodha ridge.

Tomographic analysis of seismograms recorded on a network of 35 broad-band seismographs shows the uppermost mantle shear wave speeds to be as high as 4.9 km s-1 in the northwestern Dharwar Craton, decreasing both towards the south and the east. Below {\~{}}100 km, the shear wave speed beneath the Dharwar Craton is close to the global average shear wave speed at these depths. Limitations of usable Rayleigh phase periods, however, have restricted the analysis to depths of 120 km, precluding the delineation of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary in this region. However, pressure-temperature analysis of xenoliths in the region suggests a lithospheric thickness of at least {\~{}}185 km during the mid-Proterozoic period. The investigations were motivated by a search for seismic indicators in the shallow mantle beneath the distinctly different parts of the Dharwar Craton otherwise distinguished by their lithologies, ages and crustal structure. Since the ages of cratonic crust and of the associated mantle lithosphere around the globe have been found to be broadly similar and their compositions bimodal in time, any distinguishing features of the various parts of the Dharwar shallow mantle could thus shed light on the craton formation process responsible for stabilizing the craton during the Meso-and Neo-Archean. {\textcopyright} The Authors 2014.

abstract = {The two-dimensional low-Reynolds-number dynamics of a viscous layer of fluid (salt) moving bouyantly through a viscous fluid of another viscosity and density (sedimentary strata) is modeled by means of a special finite element model. The numerical calculation follows the movement of the interface between the two fluids through a finite element mesh, which remains stationary in space. This approach facilitates the study of the large deformations of the interface caused by a small initial disturbance. The finite element model takes care of different physical parameters such as the ratios of viscosities and heights of the two layers, the density contrast between the two fluids and the boundary conditions. The first stage (salt pillow) of the growing "salt dome" can be described by a linearized Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Close agreement exists between the results of the finite element model and known analytical solutions. In the second stage (diapir stage) distortion of the interface between the two different fluids is large enough to invalidate the linearized analysis. Now the results of model experiments with oils and glycerine can be directly compared with the finite element calculations. Distinct similarity has been found between photographs from model experiments published by Whitehead and Luther (1975) and computer plots derived from the finite element model. If an isolated initial disturbance in the interface between the two fluids is used instead of a sinusoidal deflection, even the development of salt dome families can be analysed by means of this finite element model. The model shows the growing pattern of each salt dome as well as the distance in space and time between the different members of the salt dome family. The analytical description of this phenomena is possible for the linear stage by means of a Fourier analysis of the initial disturbance. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

abstract = {For the first time in the history of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame, the ITRF2000 combines unconstrained space geodesy solutions that are free from any tectonic plate motion model. Minimum constraints are applied to these solutions solely in order to define the underlying terrestrial reference frame (TRF). The ITRF2000 origin is defined by the Earth center of mass sensed by satellite laser ranging (SLR) and its scale by SLR and very long baseline interferometry. Its orientation is aligned to the ITRF97 at epoch 1997.0, and its orientation time evolution follows, conventionally, that of the no-net-rotation NNR-NUVEL-1A model. The ITRF2000 orientation and its rate are implemented using a consistent geodetic method, anchored over a selection of ITRF sites of high geodetic quality, ensuring a datum definition at the 1 mm level. This new frame is the most extensive and accurate one ever developed, containing about 800 stations located at about 500 sites, with better distribution over the globe compared to past ITRF versions but still with more site concentration in western Europe and North America. About 50{\%} of station positions are determined to better than 1 cm, and about 100 sites have their velocity estimated to at (or better than) 1 mm/yr level. The ITRF2000 velocity field was used to estimate relative rotation poles for six major tectonic plates that are independent of the TRF orientation rate. A comparison to relative rotation poles of the NUVEL-1A plate motion model shows vector differences ranging between 0.03° and 0.08°/m.y. (equivalent to approximately 1–7 mm/yr over the Earth's surface). ITRF2000 angular velocities for four plates, relative to the Pacific plate, appear to be faster than those predicted by the NUVEL-1A model. The two most populated plates in terms of space geodetic sites, North America and Eurasia, exhibit a relative Euler rotation pole of about 0.056 (±0.005)°/m.y. faster than the pole predicted by NUVEL-1A and located about (10°N, 7°E) more to the northwest, compared to that model.},

abstract = {The dynamic analysis of a structure subjected to an earthquake ground motion requires an earthquake acceleration-time history, an accelerogram. It is ideal to use a true site specific accelerogram. However, actual ground motion records are still scarce, and it is unlikely that the site-specific accelerogram is available for a project. It is natural to resort to simulated accelerograms. In this study, a user-oriented artificial earthquake simulation program, EQGEN86, was coded to perform motion simulation. The program was developed on the Prime computer system and written in FORTRAN77. In this program, the following databases were implemented: three empirical models of strong motion by Chang, Seed, and Trifunac, a peak ground acceleration database, a strong motion duration database, and an attenuation database. Additionally, a magnitude and source-site distance dependent envelope function was also implemented to realistically simulate an earthquake acceleration-time history. To obtain a simulated earthquake acceleration-time history using EQGEN86, a user will have to specify earthquake magnitude, source-site distance, local site condition, and design spectrum. Based on the above conditions specified by a user, using a stationary stochastic process with a deterministic envelope function, and the fast Fourier transformation algorithm, a spectrum-compatible accelerogram can be simulated in just a few iterations. For each set of user specified condition, many spectrum-compatible accelerograms can be simulated. The accelerograms so obtained can be used in the seismic analysis of structures in the situation where no actual ground motion records are available. The design spectrum can also be obtained, if so desired, from the strong motion database implemented in the program. It is advised, however, the magnitude, source-site distance, local site condition, and design spectrum be selected by an expert engineering seismologist. {\textcopyright} 1987, Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We present a simple conceptual model in which the entire lithosphere is in steady-state failure equilibrium-brittle failure in the upper crust and ductile creep in the lower crust and upper mantle - in response to finite, buoyancy-related plate tectonic forces. We demonstrate that, in the context of finite plate driving forces, high crustal strength provides a first-order constraint on the rate at which intraplate lithosphere deforms. For strike-slip stress states and moderate intraplate heat flow (∼0 ± 6 mW m-2), average strain rates are less than 10-17 s-1, consistent with the upper bounds imposed by rigid-plate assumptions inherent in plate tectonic reconstructions as well as with average intraplate strain rates measured by very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Because regions of higher heat flow are characterized by low effective viscosity in the lower crust and upper mantle, the available plate driving forces are sufficient to cause faster creep at depth (and higher seismicity rates in the overlying brittle crust) than in in regions of lower heat flow. We suggest that the current debate over whether intraplate deformation is best viewed in terms of a deforming continuum or as rigid crustal blocks separated by relatively narrow and weak fault zones may be a false dichotomy. We illustrate this for the Coast Ranges and Central Valley of western California. In the Coast Ranges, a region of high heat flow, high deformation rates are expected because of correspondingly high temperatures in the lower crust and upper mantle. The adjacent Central Valley is characterized by very low heat flow and deforms at such a slow rate that it appears to behave as a rigid block. Finally, in the context of steady-state lithospheric failure equilibrium, we demonstrate that the Holocene concentration of intraplate seismicity in the New Madrid seismic zone can be explained in terms of the stress perturbation caused by retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet and anomalous upper mantle structure beneath the Late Precambrian Reelfoot rift.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Author(s). The paper deals with a problem of rock finite element modelling and simulation. The main intention of authors was to present possibilities of different approaches in case of rock constitutive modelling. For this purpose granite rock was selected, due to its wide mechanical properties recognition and prevalence in literature. Two significantly different constitutive material models were implemented to simulate the granite fracture in various configurations: Johnson - Holmquist ceramic model which is very often used for predicting rock and other brittle materials behavior, and a simple linear elastic model with a brittle failure which can be used for simulating glass fracturing. Four cases with different loading conditions were chosen to compare the aforementioned constitutive models: uniaxial compression test, notched three-point-bending test, copper ball impacting a block test and small scale blasting test.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional laboratory experiments have been designed to investigate the way slab-bearing plates move during subduction inside the mantle. In our experiments a viscous plate of silicone (lithosphere) subducts under its negative buoyancy in a viscous layer of pure honey (mantle). Varying thickness, width, viscosity, and density of the plate and mantle, three characteristic modes of subduction are observed: a retreating trench mode (mode I), a retreating trench mode following a transient period of advancing trench (mode II), and an advancing trench mode (mode III). These modes are characterized by different partitioning of the amount of subduction into plate and trench motion. Our experiments show that the velocity of subduction can be modeled by the dynamic interaction between acting and resisting forces, where lithospheric bending represents 75-95{\%} of the total resisting forces. However, our experimental results also show the impossibility to predict a priori the plate velocity only from the velocity of subduction without considering trench migrations. We find experimentally that the lithospheric radius of curvature, which depends upon plate characteristics (stiffness and thickness) and the mantle thickness, exerts a primary control on the trench behavior. Our results suggest that the complexity of the style of subduction could be controlled by geometrical rules of a plate bending inside a stratified mantle. The Earth system is in the crucial range for the interplay between the rigidity of the plate and the mantle stratification: this setting may be the responsible for the complexity of the past and present tectonic styles.

The kinematic and thermal boundary conditions as well as the rheological parameters represent the current state of the study area. In future works the model will be refined using a systematic study of physical parameters in order to estimate the influence of the main parameters (e.g. viscosity, fault friction, velocity, shear heating) on the results of the reference model presented here.

abstract = {The nonlinear soil amplification models developed by Walling et al. (2008) are revisited for two main reasons: (a) the simulation database on which the models were developed has been updated and extended, with additional magnitudes and soil profiles, and (b) two alternatives for the input shaking parameter are explored – the Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) and the spectral acceleration for each period, (Sa(T)). The benefits and limitations of each alternative are discussed. The model is based on site amplification factors, relative to a VS30=1170 m/sec site,computed for 53 base soil profiles using the RASCALS computer program. The base profiles include ten VS30 values (160 m/sec, 190 m/sec, 270 m/sec, 400 m/sec, 560 m/sec, 760 m/sec, 900 m/sec, 1170 m/sec, 2830 m/sec, and 3150 m/sec), up to eight soil depths (25 ft, 50 ft, 120 ft, 250 ft, 500 ft, 1000 ft, 2000 ft, 3000 ft), and four nonlinear soil models (EPRI and Peninsular range models for cohesionless soils and Imperial Valley and Bay Mud models for cohesive soils). For each soil profile, the site response is computed for 11 levels of input rock motion: PGA1170= 0.01g, 0.05g, 0.1g, 0.2g, 0.3g, 0.4g, 0.5g, 0.75g, 1.0, 1.25g, 1.5g, produced by three point-source magnitudes: M = 5.0, 6.0, 7.0. For each base soil profile, the shear-wave velocities, layer thickness and the nonlinear soil properties (strain dependence of the G/Gmax and hysteretic damping) are randomized. Correlation of the velocities and layer thickness variations are considered. For each base profile, source magnitude and input ground motion level, the median amplification and the standard deviation of the amplification are computed from 30 realizations of the soil profiles and material properties. These results are intended for use by the NGA developers to constrain the nonlinear scaling of the site response for the ground motion models.},

@article{Sharafi2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Saudi Society for Geosciences. Damages of underground structure buried in liquefiable soils under earthquake loadings have always been a main concern for geotechnical engineering practices. As an earthquake causes the ground to liquefy, the effective stress and hence the shear strength of the soil decrease sharply and large deformations happen in the area. Of course, this phenomenon occurs only rarely when the liquefaction occurs at a large depth. However, deformations increase extensively when this layer is located in shallow depths near the ground level. In this case, super structures as tunnels and also underground structures may be severely damaged. Pipelines and manholes buried in saturated sand deposits, during earthquake loading, could damage from resulting uplift due to excess pore water pressure generation. Especially for previously buried pipelines, in order to set the priority for seismic retrofit, evaluating the risk of floatation in each region could be a concern. In this paper, effects of several parameters including dilatancy and friction angle of soil, density ratio of natural soil, diameter and burial depth of pipe on uplift of pipe by construct, an advanced soil pipe model in FLAC 2D software, and Finn behavior model under cyclic loading have been investigated. The results show that soil parameters such as friction angle, pipe diameter and optimal depth of buried pipes have a significant impact in reducing the buoyancy force.},

abstract = {Near-field ground-motion data are available in semi-real time either from modern strong-motion or continuous Global Positioning System (GPS) networks, allowing robust solutions for earthquake source parameters, which are useful for rapid disaster assessment and early warning. These wide applications require the groundmotion data to cover a very broad frequency band that, however, is usually not available. This paper presents a case study on the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku earthquake, showing how the ground-motion information from geodetic and seismic instrumentations is complementary, and suggesting the joint use of both types of data, particularly when the network coverage is sparse. First the strong-motion records from the two Japanese networks, K-NET and KiK-Net, are analyzed using an automatic empirical baseline correction tool. The static coseismic displacement data are obtained by double integration and then used to derive the permanent slip distribution on the earthquake fault. Comparisons with the corresponding GPS-based solutions yield a quantitative estimation of uncertainties of the empirical baseline correction. Furthermore, a dozen nearby GPS and strong-motion station pairs are selected to demonstrate that the information in their time series agrees with each other. Finally, methods for combining both types of ground-motion observation systems are discussed, and the wide applicability of this approach is highlighted.},

abstract = {Earthquake stability assessment of large opencast mine slopes are complex and non-linear problems, often addressed using pseudo-static approaches neglecting material-induced failures and the role of pore-fluids. In this study, a numerical approach is used to understand the dynamic response of saturated and partially saturated soils. For this purpose user-defined elements have been implemented in Abaqus/Standard including user-defined material models. The governing equations involving coupled fluid flow and finite deformation processes in partially saturated soils are derived within the framework of the Theory of Porous Media. The stress-strain behavior of granular soils is represented by a hypoplastic constitutive model and for clayey soils the ISA-Clay model is used. The saturation-suction behavior is modeled using the van Genuchten model. To account for the large scale of the finite element model, a scaling procedure of the system of equations is proposed to purge the influence of initial stress. The performance of the user-defined elements is tested by back analysis of a centrifuge test available in the literature. Finally, large-scale fully coupled finite element simulations are performed to study the response of a flooded opencast mine under earthquake loading. The paper illustrates the importance of accounting the pore-fluids as independent phases in the context of seismic analysis of slopes and the influence of simplifications on which the calculation is based are highlighted. The simulations show strong wave diffraction effects for inhomogeneous dump structures, resulting in smaller displacements in near-surface areas of the slope. Further it was found that large areas of the dump show a temporary decrease of effective stress. The initial strong differences in stiffness between the different materials may decrease with time after several seismic events due stress redistributions caused by earthquakes.},

The Godavari Graben is filled with a maximum of 2.8 km thick Lower Gondwana (Upper Permian to Lower Triassic) sediments. It is inferred on the basis of P-wave velocities that the Upper Precambrian Pakhal Formation does not continue south of Paloncha. The Upper Gondwana (Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous rocks with marine incursions appear to continue towards the southeast for about 15 km from the exposures, below the Rajahmundry sandstone (Mio-Pliocene). Two-dimensional velocity modelling of the upper crust indicates a major interface at 3.5 km depth in the upper crust where the velocity increases from 5.4-5.5 km s-1 to 6.2-6.4 km s-1. This interface shows a dpmal upwarp across the Godavari Graben which may be an indication of NE-SW crustal extension in this region. The deeper part of the crust consists of a large number of almost horizontal small reflector segments. Two-dimensional crustal velocity modelling for some correlatable wide-angle reflections yielded a three-layered structure below 10 km depth, with the Moho at about 41 to 43 km. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

A rheological model is discussed that accounts for visco-elastic (primary) and visco-plastic (secondary) contributions to rock creep. The effects of tertiary creep are included in the model by way of a gradual mechanical damage governed by the cumulated visco-plastic strains. The parameters of the intact rock are first identified based on laboratory test results presented in the literature. Then, after scaling them to those of the rock mass, the potential applicability of the model is tested through axisymmetric and plane strain finite element analyses of the full face excavation of a deep circular tunnel. The results are discussed with particular reference to the short term redistribution of stresses around the opening and to its convergence. The analyses show the relevant influence of tertiary creep on the tunnel closure. In addition, those based on an axisymmetric scheme turn out to be crucial for the correct long term prediction of the interaction between the rock mass and the supporting structure of the opening. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

The code solves, by means of a finite difference scheme, the heat transfer equation including adiabatic heating, radioactive heat generation, latent heat associated with phase changes and frictional heating. We show, with a few simulations, that TEMSPOL can be a useful tool for researchers studying seismic velocity, stress and seismicity distribution in deep subduction zones. Deep earthquakes in subducting slabs are thought to be caused by shear instabilities associated with the olivine to spinel phase transition in metastable olivine wedges. We investigate the kinematic and thermal conditions of the subducting plate that lead to the formation of metastable olivine wedges. Moreover, TEMSPOL calculates lateral anomalies of density within subducting slabs, which can be used to evaluate buoyancy forces that determine the dynamics of subduction and the stress distribution within the slab. We use TEMSPOL to evaluate the effects of heat sources such as shear heating and latent heat release, which are neglected in commonly used thermal models of subduction. We show that neglecting these heat sources can lead to significant overestimation of the depth reached by the metastable olivine wedge. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The focus of this paper is to investigate reverse fault rupture propagation through two layers of sand deposit by means of numerical modeling. For this purpose, analyses are carried out for different permutations of three typical materials: dense sand, medium dense sand and loose sand, considering five fault dip angles: 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 degrees, respectively. The validity of the numerical model was verified by simulating an experimental model of a homogeneous soil layer subjected to reverse faulting. Further to the general trends found in fault rupture propagation in a single layer of soil, special attention is devoted to the refraction of the fault path in the interface of two materials, as well as its concavity in the continuation. Moreover, four patterns of fault rapture propagation in two-layered sands, depending on their arrangements and fault dip angles, were concluded from the results. {\textcopyright} 2014 Sharif University of Technology.

abstract = {Viscoelastic materials undergo creep due to elasticity and viscosity, two intrinsic material characteristics, and a representative rheological model can be constructed for creep behavior analysis. Based on the viscoelasticity theory, this model simulates creep by formalizing elastic and viscous deformations in spring and dash-pot elements, respectively. However , most materials have internal gaps caused by the generation process, changes in the internal or external stress, etc. In this paper, a rheological model is proposed in which a gap is introduced; hence, the phenomenological behaviors are formalized using spring, dash-pot, and gap elements. The gap element has strain, but no material property. The opening or closing of the gap according to time history influences the structural changes in the model. Owing to the gap element, the energy due to external forces is dissipated before the gap is closed. After the gap is closed, it is converted and stored as internal strain energy in the spring element, which causes creep recovery. The proposed rheological model has two types, which depend on the element combination. Further, a generalized model is obtained by constructing n models on the basis of the element material properties. To validate the proposed rheological model for various stress conditions, the results predicted by three creep models (the proposed model, Burgers model, and the step-by-step method) are compared with the previously experimental results of concrete specimens because there is a large difference between the evaluations of internally stored strain energy by the creep prediction models. Analysis of a stepwise loading case and an unloading case reveal the following characteristics and mechanism of the model. When additional stress is applied, the principle of superposition is not applied to the proposed model. Instead, the model predicts creep by considering the linearity and structural change of each element. In addition, the proposed model simulates creep recovery and permanent strain more precisely compared to other creep models, which occur due to stress removal, by considering the structural change caused by the gap.},

We also show that the earthquakes in the lower portion of the Wadati-Benioff zone width are generally fewer and smaller than those in the central portions, with only 8{\%} of the total moment released in the period 1976–1996 being due to earthquakes on the lower side.},

abstract = {The paper addresses the application of effective tools for investigating structural integrity under earthquake loading, namely experimental testing, computer analysis and field data collection, and their combination. In particular, the application of hybrid (experimental-analytical) distributed (using several sites) simulation, hereafter referred to as HDS, to investigate seismic response of complex systems is presented. After briefly reviewing and comparing approaches of field surveys, testing, analysis and hybrid simulation, the paper deals with five applications where at least two of the three tools have been successfully applied. The collapse of the I-880 (Cypress Viaduct) during the Loma Prieta (California) earthquake of 1989 was investigated analytically following field observation of the failure modes. A plausible mechanism was postulated based on advanced analysis and supported by field data. Analytical studies aimed at quantifying the demand imposed on steel moment frames in the Northridge (California) earthquake of 1994 pointed towards a possible contribution of vertical beam modes to the increased rotational demand imposed on connections, leading to their failure. Next, issues of irregularity and lack of seismic detailing in RC buildings, repeatedly observed to be a major contributor to damage, are studied at full scale using laboratory testing, supported by advanced analysis to steer the model design and tune the level of input motion. Reinforced concrete bridges are also studied, using advanced analysis and field observations to investigate the partial collapse of a ramp structure part of the Santa Monica Freeway (I-10). Finally, two examples of applications of hybrid distributed simulation (HDS) are presented, one of which is a continuation of the steel moment frames analytical investigation. It is emphasized that it is only through integrating the available investigation tools that the response of complex systems may be understood, leading to more economical and safer built environments in regions subjected to earthquakes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Active subduction of the Indian plate is currently occurring beneath the Burmese arc along an east dipping Benioff zone which extends to a depth of about 180 km. The overriding Burma plate has an appearance of an inland seismic slab that is deflected downwards in the vicinity of the Benioff zone. A crustal seismic zone some 60-80 km east of the Benioff zone correlates to backarc activity. A triangular aseismic wedge in the top part of the crust outlines the Central Belt molasse basin east of the Burmese foldbdt. Fault plane solutions show that the Burmese Benioff zone is characterized by shallow angle thrusting at its upper edge whereas down-tip tensional events dominate its lower edge. Most of the backarc seismicity is accounted for by the Sagaing transform or by the activity of the Shan scarp normal fault zone at the margin of the Asian plate. A gravity anomaly pair with amplitude of 175 mGal coincides with the 1100-km long Burmese arc lying in a north-south direction. The gravity anomalies along a profile in central Burma and in adjacent areas of the Bengal basin are interpreted in terms of plate subduction as well as near-surface mass anomalies. This suggests that sediments below the Central Belt may have an average thickness of the order of 10 km but may be as thick as 15 km at the subduction zone. The oceanic crust underlying deeper parts of the Bengal basin experiences phase transition at about 30 km depth in a Benioff zone environment east of the Burmese foldbelt. Several thrust planes are present within the folded and deformed Cretaceous-Tertiary sediments of the fold belt; these are often associated with ophiolites and basic to ultrabasic rocks. A low density zone, at least 60 km wide, underlies the andesitic volcanic axis in the overriding plate. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {We develop a three-dimensional viscoelastic finite element model to study postseismic deformation associated with the 1960 great Chile earthquake. GPS observations 35 years after the earthquake show that, while all coastal sites are moving landward, a group of inland sites 200 - 400 km from the trench are moving seaward and that coastal velocities in the 1960 rupture area are distinctly smaller than those to the north. We explain these observations in terms of mantle stress relaxation. The earthquake stretches the upper plate to move seaward, but elastic stresses coseismically induced in the upper mantle resist this motion. Stress relaxation allows seaward motion to take place in the inland area for several decades following the earthquake. With a viscosity of 2.5 × 1019 Pa s for the continental upper mantle, the model well explains the GPS observations. Numerical tests suggest that the continental mantle viscosity value is reasonably well constrained. The model shows the prolonged postseismic seaward motion of the inland area to be a unique feature of earthquakes with very long rupture along strike and large coseismic fault slip. For short rupture and small coseismic slip, the motion will stop very quickly after the earthquake, explaining why this phenomenon is not more commonly observed. With an oceanic mantle viscosity of 1020 Pa s, the model also provides an explanation for tide-gauge constrained postseismic uplift 200 km from the trench that had previously been explained using a model of prolonged afterslip of a deep segment of the Chile subduction fault.},

abstract = {The equatorial region of the conventionally defined Indo-Australian plate has long been recognized as containing a type example of intense "intraplate" deformation. We trace the development of tectonic models for the area to illustrate techniques for the analysis of such deformation. The identification of anomalous seismicity near the Ninetyeast and Chagos-Laccadive Ridges demonstrated the existence of the deformation. Focal mechanisms from recent and historic earthquakes showed strike-slip motion occurring along the Ninetyeast Ridge; seismic moment data allowed the rate to be estimated. Similar studies showed north-south tension in the Chagos Bank region and north-south compression in the region between the Ninetyeast and Chagos ridges. Global plate motion studies indicated non-closure of the Indian Ocean triple junction, suggesting the conventional plate geometry was inadequate for a rigid plate description of the area. Gravity and marine geophysical data indicated intense north-south compressional deformation south of the Bay of Bengal. These observations are reconciled by a plate motion model in which Australia and India lie on distinct plates divided by a boundary that intersects the Central Indian Ridge near the equator. In this model Arabia, usually considered a separate plate, has negligible motion relative to India. The resulting Euler vector for Australia relative to Indo-Arabia lies just east of the Central Indian Ridge, and predicts approximately 0.5-1.5 cm/yr compression in the Central Indian Basin and 1.5-2 cm/yr strike-slip motion along the northern Ninetyeast Ridge, consistent with the seismological and geophysical data. In contrast to conventional oceanic plate boundaries, the boundary deformation is distributed over a wide zone. This diffuse nature may reflect either the boundary's recent inception or slow rate of motion. Analysis of seismicity and deformation in the boundary zone should offer insights into the mechanics of its development and its implications for the evolution of plate boundaries. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

The ductile fracture criterion couples effect of stress triaxiality on void growth, and assumes the shear linking-up of voids governed by the largest shear stress. The criterion is developed based on an isotropic strain rate potential computed from an isotropic damage equivalent strain rate vector, which is mapped from the plastic strain rate vector by a forth order linear transformation tensor. The proposed anisotropic ductile fracture criterion is applied to depict anisotropic ductile fracture of AA 6K21 in shear, uniaxial tension and plane strain tension along different loading directions, and the balanced biaxial tension. The predicted fracture strain and fracture locus are compared with experimental results for the verification of the proposed criterion. The comparison demonstrates that the ductile fracture criterion properly models the anisotropy in ductile fracture under shear, uniaxial tension, plane strain tension and balanced biaxial tension with high accuracy. It shows that the proposed anisotropic ductile fracture criterion can be utilized to predict the onset of ductile fracture in plastic deformation and metal forming of lightweight metals with approximately proportional loading.},

abstract = {Subduction of young oceanic lithosphere cannot be explained by the gravitational driving mechanisms of slab pull and ridge push. This deficiency of driving forces can be overcome by obduction of an actively overriding plate, which forces the young plate either to subduct or to collide. This mechanism leads to shallow flattening of the slab as observed today under parts of the west coast of North and South America. Here this process is examined by means of numerical modeling. The convergence velocity between oceanic and continental lithospheric plates is computed from the modeling results, and the ratio of the subduction velocity over the overriding velocity is used as a diagnostic of the efficiency of the ongoing subduction process. We have investigated several factors influencing the mechanical resistance working against the subduction process. In particular, we have studied the effect of a preexisting lithospheric fault with a depth dependent shear resistance, partly decoupling the oceanic lithosphere from the overriding continent. We also investigated the lubricating effect of a 7 km thick basaltic crustal layer on the efficiency of the subduction process and found a log-linear relation between convergence rate and viscosity prefactor characterizing the strength of the oceanic crust, for a range of parameter values including values for basaltic rocks, derived from empirical data. A strong mantle fixes the subducting slab while being overridden and prevents the slab from further subduction in a Benioff style. Viscous heating lowers the coupling strength of the crustal interface between the converging plates with about half an order of magnitude and therefore contributes significantly to the subduction process. Finally, when varying the overriding velocity from 2.5 to 10 cm yr-1, we found a non-linear increase of the subduction velocity due to the presence of non-linear mantle rheology. These results indicate that active obduction of oceanic lithosphere by an overriding continental lithosphere is a viable mechanism for shallow flat subduction over a wide range of model parameters.

abstract = {In the present paper, a numerical model is developed based on a combination of the extended finite element method and an equivalent continuum model to simulate the two-phase fluid flow through fractured porous media containing fractures with multiple length scales. The governing equations involve the linear momentum balance equation and the flow continuity equation for each fluid phase. The extended finite element method allows for an explicit and accurate representation of cracks by enriching the standard finite element approximation of the field variables with appropriate enrichment functions, and captures the mass transfer between the fracture and the matrix. Due to the high computational cost of X-FEM, this technique is only used to model large fractures. The pre-existing short fractures, which are distributed randomly in the porous medium, contribute to the increase of the effective permeability tensor and are modeled with an equivalent continuum model. Finally, the robustness of the proposed computational model is demonstrated through several numerical examples, and the effects of crack orientation, capillary pressure function, solid skeleton deformation, and existence of short cracks on the pattern of fluid flow are investigated. It is shown that the developed model provides a correct prediction of flow pattern for different crack configurations.},

abstract = {As we continue searching for exoplanets, we wonder if life and technological species capable of communicating with us exists on any of them. As geoscientists, we can also wonder how important is the presence or absence of plate tectonics for the evolution of technological species. This essay considers this question, focusing on tectonically active rocky (silicate) planets, like Earth, Venus, and Mars. The development of technological species on Earth provides key insights for understanding evolution on exoplanets, including the likely role that plate tectonics may play. An Earth-sized silicate planet is likely to experience several tectonic styles over its lifetime, as it cools and its lithosphere thickens, strengthens, and becomes denser. These include magma ocean, various styles of stagnant lid, and perhaps plate tectonics. Abundant liquid water favors both life and plate tectonics. Ocean is required for early evolution of diverse single-celled organisms, then colonies of cells which specialized further to form guts, appendages, and sensory organisms up to the complexity of fish (central nervous system, appendages, eyes). Large expanses of dry land also begin in the ocean, today produced above subduction zones in juvenile arcs and by their coalescence to form continents, although it is not clear that plate tectonics was required to create continental crust on Earth. Dry land of continents is required for further evolution of technological species, where modification of appendages for grasping and manipulating, and improvement of eyes and central nervous system could be perfected. These bioassets allowed intelligent creatures to examine the night sky and wonder, the beginning of abstract thinking, including religion and science. Technology arises from the exigencies of daily living such as tool-making, agriculture, clothing, and weapons, but the pace of innovation accelerates once it is allied with science. Finally, the importance of plate tectonics for developing a technological species is examined via a thought experiment using two otherwise identical planets: one with plate tectonics and the other without. A planet with oceans, continents, and plate tectonics maximizes opportunities for speciation and natural selection, whereas a similar planet without plate tectonics provides fewer such opportunities. Plate tectonics exerts environmental pressures that drive evolution without being capable of extinguishing all life. Plate tectonic processes such as the redistribution of continents, growth of mountain ranges, formation of land bridges, and opening and closing of oceans provide a continuous but moderate environmental pressure that stimulates populations to adapt and evolve. Plate tectonics may not be needed in order for life to begin, but evolution of technological species is favored on planets with oceans, continents, plate tectonics, and intermittently clear night sky.},

abstract = {Regional mapping of landslide susceptibility aims to identify zones of potential instability across geological settings. Given their predictive capabilities, physically based, deterministic models are useful tools for landslide triggering studies at regional scale. However, they rely on detailed input parameters that are rarely available for large areas. To address these limitations, this work proposes a computational framework to incorporate the spatial uncertainty of input data into physically based, landslide hazard zonation models through the use of regional scale random fields (RSRF). For this purpose, input parameters are treated as spatially correlated random variables with assigned statistical attributes, while a vectorization strategy is used to reduce the computational cost of large-scale stochastic analyses. Deterministic simulations based on a hydro-mechanical model are then performed for multiple Monte Carlo realizations to compute maps of failure probability (pf). The methodology was applied to a well-documented series of rainfall-induced shallow landslides in a volcanic site for which field measurements were available to constrain the statistical variability of the hydraulic conductivity and treat this parameter as an RSRF. To analyze the results, four classes of landslide susceptibility characterized by different pf thresholds were used. Such classes were mapped over the study zone and throughout the storm event, allowing a direct comparison with the spatio-temporal evidence of landslide triggering. The results indicate that (i) uncertainty analyses neglecting the role of spatial correlation may lead to non-conservative estimates of landslide susceptibility and (ii) there is an interval of spatial correlation distance that optimizes the performance of the model, thus providing an indirect estimate of the heterogeneity of the site. Such results highlight the benefits of accounting for the uncertainty of the soil properties in regional-scale models and offer a new predictive stochastic framework to assess the implications of future rainfall scenarios over large areas.},

The weighted parametric approach was applied to determine degree of susceptibility to landslides. The landslide probability values thus obtained were classified into no risk, very low to moderate, high, and very high to severe landslide hazard risk zones.

abstract = {The present study aims at better deciphering the different mechanisms involved in the functioning of the subduction interplate. A 2D thermo-mechanical model is used to simulate a subduction channel, made of oceanic crust, free to evolve. Convergence at constant rate is imposed under a 100 km thick upper plate. Pseudo-brittle and non-Newtonian behaviours are modelled. The influence of the subduction channel strength, parameterized by the difference in activation energy between crust and mantle ($\Delta$Ea) is investigated to examine in detail the variations in depth of the subduction plane down-dip extent, zcoup. First, simulations show that numerical resolution may be responsible for an artificial and significant shallowing of zcoup if the weak crustal layer is not correctly resolved. Second, if the age of the subducting plate is 100 Myr, subduction occurs for any $\Delta$Ea. The stiffer the crust is, that is, the lower $\Delta$Ea is, the shallower zcoup is (60 km depth if $\Delta$Ea=20 kJ/mol) and the hotter the fore-arc base is. Conversely, imposing a very weak subduction channel ($\Delta$Ea{\textgreater}135 J/mol) leads there to an extreme mantle wedge cooling and inhibits mantle melting in wet conditions. Partial kinematic coupling at the fore-arc base occurs if $\Delta$Ea=145 kJ/mol. If the incoming plate is 20 Myr old, subduction can occur under the conditions that the crust is either stiff and denser than the mantle, or weak and buoyant. In the latter condition, cold crust plumes rise from the subduction channel and ascend through the upper lithosphere, triggering (1) partial kinematic coupling under the fore-arc, (2) fore-arc lithosphere cooling, and (3) partial or complete hindrance of wet mantle melting. zcoup then ranges from 50 to more than 250 km depth and is time-dependent if crust plumes form. Finally, subduction plane dynamics is intimately linked to the regime of subduction-induced corner flow. Two different intervals of $\Delta$Ea are underlined: 80–120 kJ/mol to reproduce the range of slab surface temperature inferred from geothermometry, and 10–40 kJ/mol to reproduce the shallow hot mantle wedge core inferred from conditions of last equilibration of near-primary arc magmas and seismic tomographies. Therefore, an extra process controlling mantle wedge dynamics is needed to satisfy simultaneously the aforementioned observations. A mantle viscosity reduction, by a factor 4–20, caused by metasomatism in the mantle wedge is proposed. From these results, I conclude that the subduction channel down-dip extent, zcoup, should depend on the subduction setting, to be consistent with the observed variability of sub-arc depths of the subducting plate surface.},

abstract = {The nature of crustal and lithospheric mantle evolution of the Archean shields as well as their subsequent deformation due to recent plate motions and sustained intraplate geodynamic activity, has been a subject of considerable interest. In view of this, about three decades ago, a new idea was put forward suggesting that out of all shield terrains, the Indian shield has an extremely thin lithosphere (∼100 km, compared to 250–350 km, elsewhere), apart from being warm, non-rigid, sheared and deformed. As expected, it met with scepticism by heat flow and the emerging seismic tomographic study groups, who on the contrary suggested that the Indian shield has a cool crust, besides a coherent and thick lithosphere (as much as 300–400 km) like any other shield. However, recently obtained integrated geological and geophysical findings from deep scientific drillings in 1993 Killari (Mw: 6.3) and 1967 Koyna (Mw: 6.3) earthquake zones, as well as newly acquired geophysical data over other parts of Indian shield terrain, have provided a totally new insight to this debate. Beneath Killari, the basement was found consisting of high density, high velocity mid crustal amphibolite to granulite facies rocks due to exhumation of the deeper crustal layers and sustained granitic upper crustal erosion. Similar type of basement appears to be present in Koyna region too, which is characterized by considerably high upper crustal temperatures. Since, such type of crust is depleted in radiogenic elements, it resulted into lowering of heat flow at the surface, increase in heat flow contribution from the mantle, and upwarping of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Consequently, the Indian shield lithosphere has become unusually thin and warm. This study highlights the need of an integrated geological, geochemical and geophysical approach in order to accurately determine deep crust-mantle thermal regime in continental areas.},

abstract = {Focal mechanisms of 32 North American midplate earthquakes (mb = 3.8–6.5) were evaluated to determine if slip is compatible with a broad-scale regional stress field derived from plate-driving forces and, if so, under what conditions (stress regime, pore pressure, and frictional coefficient). Using independent information on in situ stress orientations from well bore breakout and hydraulic fracturing data and assuming that the regional principal stresses are in approximately horizontal and vertical planes (±10°), the constraint that the slip vector represents the direction of maximum resolved shear stress on the fault plane was used to calculate relative stress magnitudes defined by the parameter ϕ = (S2 - S3)/(S1 - S3) from the fault/stress geometry. As long as the focal mechanism has a component of oblique slip (i.e., the B axis does not coincide with the intermediate principal stress direction), this calculation identifies which of the two nodal planes is a geometrically possible slip plane (Gephart, 1985). Slip in a majority of the earthquakes (25 of 32) was found to be geometrically compatible with reactivation of favorably oriented preexisting fault planes in response to the broad-scale uniform regional stress field. Slip in five events was clearly inconsistent with the regional stress field and appears to require a localized stress anomaly to explain the seismicity. Significantly, all five of these events occurred prior to 1970 (when many regional networks were installed), and their focal mechanisms are inconsistent with more recent solutions of nearby smaller events. The frictional likelihood of the geometrically possible slip on the selected fault planes was evaluated in the context of conventional frictional faulting theory. The ratio of shear to normal stress on the fault planes at hypocentral depth was calculated relative to an assumed regional stress field. Regional stress magnitudes were determined from (1) S1/S3 ratios based on the frictional strength of optimally oriented faults (the basis for the linear brittle portion of lithospheric strength profiles), (2) the computed relative stress magnitude (ϕ) values, and (3) a vertical principal stress assumed equal to the lithostat. Two end-member possibilities were examined to explain the observed slip in these less than optimally oriented fault planes. First, the frictional coefficient was held constant on all faults, hydrostatic pore pressure was assumed regionally, and the fault zone pore pressure was determined. Since pore pressure is a measurable quantity with real limits in the crust (P0 {\textless} S3), this end-member case was used to determine which of the geometrically possible slip planes were frictionally likely slip planes. Alternately, pore pressure was fixed at hydrostatic everywhere, and the required relative lowered frictional coefficient of the fault zone was computed. Slip in 23 of the 25 geometrically compatible earthquakes was determined to also be frictionally likely in response to an approximately horizontal and vertical regional stress field derived from plate-driving forces whose magnitudes are constrained by the frictional strength of optimally oriented faults (assuming hydrostatic pore pressure regionally). The conditions for slip on these 23 relatively “well-oriented” earthquake faults were determined relative to this regional crustal strength model and require only moderate increases in pore pressure (between about 0.4–0.8 of lithostatic, hydrostatic is about 0.37 of lithostatic) or, alternately, moderate lowering ({\textless}50{\%}) of the frictional coefficient on the faults which slipped. Superlithostatic pore pressures are not required. Focal mechanisms for the two other earthquakes with slip vectors geometrically consistent with the regional stress field, however, did require pore pressures far exceeding the least principal stress (or extremely low coefficients of friction). These events may reflect either local stress rotations undetected with current sampling or poorly constrained focal mechanisms. The analysis also confirmed a rou hly north to south contrast in stress regime between the central eastern United States and southeastern Canada previously inferred from a contrast in focal mechanisms between the two areas: most central eastern United States earthquakes occur in response to a strike-slip stress regime, whereas the southeastern Canadian events require a thrust faulting stress regime. This contrast in stress regime, with a constant maximum horizontal stress orientation determined by far-field plate-driving forces, requires a systematic lateral variation in relative stress magnitudes. Superposition of stresses due to simple flexural models of glacial rebound stresses are of the correct sense to explain the observed lateral variation, but maximum computed rebound-related stress magnitude changes are quite small (about 10 MPa) and do not appear large enough to account for the stress regime change if commonly assumed stress magnitudes determined from frictional strength apply to the crust at seismogenic depths.},

Paired gravity anomaly along with the faulted contact, dip reversal in seismic reflectivity pattern, northward vergence of the southern domain and high pressure-temperature granulites exposed on the Shevaroy hills are characteristic features of crustal thrusting through a late Archaean continental collision along the Moyar-Bhavani-Mettur shear zone. A unified 2 1/2-D gravity model along the seismic line is consistent with a tectonic history in which the Eastern Dharwar craton has been transported beneath the Southern Granulite Terrain. The gravity modeling further defines a 10 km thick high-density (2.89 g/cm3) crustal body at 10-15 km depth and a Moho warped up to a depth of about 38 km beneath the Palghat gap. The high-density intrusive body together with the upwarped Moho signifies the crust-mantle interaction in the Palghat gap region. Late Archaean continental collision and subsequent delamination are suggested as the twin cause mechanism for the present day crustal configuration along the geotransect. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

abstract = {Time-dependent features of rocks and rock masses, particularly soft rocks, may emerge in most tunnels, mines and underground constructions under different deviatoric stress levels. To account for the creep deformation of rocks associated with the wide range of stress levels, modifications are made to a visco-plastic model which was initially developed for large stresses in squeezing conditions. Firstly, the concept of plastic hardening behavior is adopted for both instantaneous and visco-plastic deformations of rocks to estimate the induced plastic deformation even at relatively low deviatoric stress levels. Secondly, the visco-plastic dashpot element is described as a function of the stress level to determine the secondary stage of creep during the unloading and reloading phases which are crucial in tunneling and underground. The governing equations of the proposed model are implemented in numerical finite difference code (FLAC), using its built-in FISH language for constitutive models and then applied to a series of laboratory creep tests presented in the literature. The presented discussion compares the numerical results relating to the modified model with the data on time-dependent deformation developed in rock specimens.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional fluid dynamic laboratory simulations are presented that investigate the subduction process in two mantle models, an upper mantle model and a deep mantle model, and for various subducting plate/mantle viscosity ratios ($\eta$SP/$\eta$M = 59-1375). The models investigate the mantle flow field, geometrical evolution of the slab, sinking kinematics, and relative contributions of subducting plate motion and trench migration to the total rate of subduction. All models show that the subducting plate is always moving trenchward resulting from slab pull. Furthermore, all deep mantle models show trench retreat, as do upper mantle models in the initial stage of subduction before slab tip-transition zone interaction. Upper mantle models with a low $\eta$SP/$\eta$M (66, 217) continue to show trench retreat after interaction. Upper mantle models with a high $\eta$SP/ $\eta$M (378, 709) show a period of trench advance after interaction followed by trench retreat. Upper mantle models with a very high $\eta$SP/$\eta$M (1375) show continued trench advance after interaction. The difference in trench migration behavior and associated slab geometries is attributed to both $\eta$SP/$\eta$M and the mantle depth to plate thickness ratio TM/TSP, which both affect the slab bending radius to mantle thickness ratio rB/TM. Four subduction regimes can be defined: Regime I with rB/TM ≤ ∼0.3, trench retreat, slab draping, and a concave trench; Regime II with ∼0.3 {\textless} rB/TM {\textless} ∼0.5, episodic trench migration, slab folding, and a concave trench; Regime III with rB/TM ≈ 0.5, trench advance, slab rollover geometries, and minor trench curvature; and Regime IV with rB/TM ≥ ∼0.8, trench retreat, slab draping, and a rectilinear trench. In all models, slab-parallel downdip motion induces poloidal mantle flow structures. In addition, trench retreat and rollback motion of the slab induce quasi-toroidal return flow around the lateral slab edges toward the mantle wedge. Rollback-induced poloidal flow around the slab tip is not observed in any of the experiments. Finally, comparison between the slab geometries observed in the upper mantle models and slab geometries observed in nature imply that the effective viscosity ratio between slab and ambient upper mantle in nature is less than 103 and of the order 1-7 × 102, with a best estimate of 1-3 × 102.

abstract = {Modelling of deformation and stress caused by earthquake faulting (or fault motion) based on a homogeneous elastic half- space model does not include crustal rigidity layering and lateral variations. Geological data and seismic surveys indicate that the crust is elastically inhomogeneous, and that rigidity layering and heterogeneities are likely to affect the magnitude and pattern of deformation and stress. We use the finite- element method (FEM) to investigate deformation and stress generated by strike- slip, tensile and thrust faulting, considering rigidity layering in the crust. For a fault with a dimension of 25 x 10 km and a slip value of 0.5 m cutting through the top 10 km of the crust, the deformation and stress change associated with the three modes of faulting are calculated for an island arc crustal structure represented by three models of rigidity layering. The results indicate: (i) The maximum effect in horizontal displacements due to crustal layering for the investigated models is 19.7 mm and 28.8 mm for strike- slip and tensile faulting, respectively. For thrust faulting, the effect is up to 58.3 mm. This remarkable effect is due to the offset of layers by thrust faulting, which dynamically changes the crustal structure both horizontally and vertically. (ii) The maximum effect in vertical deformation due to crustal rigidity layering for strike- slip and tensile faulting is 5 mm. In contrast, the effect for thrusting is 30.3 mm. (iii) The effect in the shear stress change at a depth of 7.5 km for the different styles of faulting ranges from 0.02 MPa to 0.10 MPa. An additional modelling analysis of subduction thrusting at the Japan trench with a detailed structural model based on seismic surveys further confirms the significant distortion caused by a homogeneous model that ignores crustal structural information. Overall, the effect of crustal rigidity layering is at least 20 per cent for surface deformation and 15 per cent for stress changes at depth. In light of the present accuracy of global positioning system (GPS) observations 2 mm) and the estimate of stress change required for earthquake hazard analysis (ca 0.01 MPa), the results from the numerical experiments indicate that crust inhomogeneity (rigidity layering and lateral variations) should be included in any quantitative models of faulting.},

The results of the simulated experiment show that the inversion accuracy of the parameters of the seismic slip distribution with the smoothing factor determined by the eclectic intersection curve method is better than that of the L curve method. Moreover, the eclectic intersection curve method and the L curve method are used to determine the smoothing factor of L'Aquila and Taiwan Meinong earthquake slip distribution inversion respectively, and the inversion results are compared and analyzed.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.This book addresses the geology of the entire Himalayan range in Nepal, i.e., from the Gangetic plain in the south to the Tethyan zone in the north. Without a comprehensive look at the various Himalayan zones, it is practically impossible to fully grasp the processes at work behind the formation and development of the spectacular Himalaya. However, the goal is not merely to document all the scientific ontology but rather to reveal a sound basis for the prevailing concepts. Both the early literature on Himalayan geology and contemporary trends are fully covered. For the first time, the origin, use, and abuse of common Himalayan geological terms such as the Siwaliks, Lesser Himalaya, Main Boundary Thrust, Main Central Thrust, and Tethys are discussed. The book will help readers to progress from a cognitive approach to a constructive one by linking various types of knowledge, such as seeking relations between various geological structures as well as between earlier thoughts or views and contemporary approaches.},

abstract = {Over the last few years or so, the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has increased in many areas of engineering. In particular, ANNs have been applied to many geotechnical engineering problems and have demonstrated some degree of success. A review of the literature reveals that ANNs have been used successfully in pile capacity prediction, modelling soil behaviour, site characterisation, earth retaining structures, settlement of structures, slope stability, design of tunnels and underground openings, liquefaction, soil permeability and hydraulic conductivity, soil compaction, soil swelling and classification of soils. The objective of this paper is to provide a general view of some ANN applications for solving some types of geotechnical engineering problems. It is not intended to describe the ANNs modelling issues in geotechnical engineering. The paper also does not intend to cover every single application or scientific paper that found in the literature. For brevity, some works are selected to be described in some detail, while others are acknowledged for reference purposes. The paper then discusses the strengths and limitations of ANNs compared with the other modelling approaches.},

abstract = {The All-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial Explorer (ATHLETE) is a mobile lunar lander under development by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Lunar Architecture Team. While previous lunar missions have lasted only a few days, the ATHLETE is designed to last for 10 years, which will enable a sustained U.S. presence on the moon and exploration of the more treacherous regions which are not suitable for landing. Because the ATHLETE will carry entire astronaut habitats, its six wheels must be carefully designed to support a large load on soft lunar soil efficiently. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a finite element model that will allow designers to examine how the tractive performance of the lunar wheel is affected by changes in the wheel geometry through numerical analysis. It has been shown in the literature that a wheel rolling on soil is not suited to a plane strain analysis. Two different three-dimensional deformable wheel models are explored, a single-part shell model and a multi-part solid-shell model. For the purposes of this research, the shell model offers sufficient detail with less computational expense. The key to obtaining a smooth pressure distribution is in careful selection of the contact stiffness. For the soil model, a set of parameters to represent a pressure-dependent elasto-plastic cap hardening lunar soil was assembled. Two different methods of selecting an appropriate soil bed size are compared. A holistic method that determines all dimensions at once was found to be quick and reliable. Finally, the wheel and soil models were integrated into one finite element model in the commercial code, AbaqusTM, and three small studies were conducted to demonstrate the utility of the model in predicting changes in traction dues to change in wheel design and operation. For example, the model can help determine how quickly the wheel can accelerate without significant slippage. The model can also inform design decisions. The pilot tests suggested that softening the cylinders and/or the spokes could improve traction, but softening the cylinders too much can lead to structural failure.},

To clarify this tectonic interaction and the$\backslash$nunderlying dynamics, we determine the regional seismotectonic stress$\backslash$nfrom the stress inversion of 285 double couple focal mechanism solutions$\backslash$nof earthquakes with an average magnitude of 5. We then compare the$\backslash$nreconstructed stress regimes with the available information about$\backslash$ngeodetically determined relative displacements. North-south compression,$\backslash$nin a direction consistent with India-Eurasia convergence, prevails$\backslash$nin the whole area from the Eastern Himalayas to the Bengal Basin,$\backslash$nthrough the Shillong-Mikir Massif and the Upper Assam Valley. E-W$\backslash$nextension in Tibet is related to this N-S India-Eurasia convergence.$\backslash$nNot only does the major N-S compression affect the outer segments$\backslash$nof the Indo-Burma Ranges, it also extends into the descending slab$\backslash$nof Indian lithosphere below these ranges, although stresses at depth$\backslash$nare controlled by bending of the slab beneath the Burmese arc. The$\backslash$nexistence of widespread N-S compression in the Bengal Basin, far$\backslash$naway from the Himalayan front, is compatible with the previously$\backslash$nproposed convergence between a Shillong-Mikir- Assam Valley block$\backslash$nand the Indian craton. E-W compression inside this block supports$\backslash$nthe hypothesis of a component of eastward extrusion. Stress inversion$\backslash$nof focal mechanism solutions in the Indo-Burma Ranges reveals a complex$\backslash$nstress pattern. The Burmese arc and its underlying lithosphere experience$\backslash$nnearly arc-perpendicular extension with ESE-WNW trends in the northernmost,$\backslash$nNE-trending segment and ENE-WSW trends in the main N-S arc segment.$\backslash$nSuch extensional stress, documented from many arcs, is likely a response$\backslash$nto pull from and bending of the subducting plate. At the same time,$\backslash$nthe Indo-Burma Ranges are under compression as a result of oblique$\backslash$nconvergence between the Sunda and Indian plates. The maximum compressive$\backslash$nstress rotates from NE-SW across the inner and northern arc to E-W$\backslash$nnear the Bengal Basin. This rotation is consistent with the deformation$\backslash$npartitioning reflected in the rotation of relative displacement vectors,$\backslash$nfrom a SSW-directed Sunda-Burma motion to a WSW-directed Burma-India$\backslash$nmotion. As a consequence of this partitioning, the major belt-parallel$\backslash$nfault zones show a variety of movements across the main N-S arc segment,$\backslash$nfrom right-lateral slip in the inner ranges to oblique reverse-dextral$\backslash$nslip in the outer ranges and pure thrusting in the westernmost foreland$\backslash$nbelt.},

abstract = {An airborne gravity survey of Nepal was carried out December 2010 in a cooperation between DTU-Space, Nepal Survey Department, and NGA, USA. The entire country was flown with survey lines spaced 6 nm with a Beech King Air aircraft, with a varying flight altitude from 4 to 10 km. The survey operations were a major challenge due to excessive jet streams at altitude as well as occasional excessive mountain waves. Despite the large 400 mGal + range of gravity anomaly changes from the Indian plains to the Tibetan Plateau, results appear accurate to few mGal, with proper evaluation from cross-overs complicated by the high varying flight altitudes. Using a downward continuation scheme based on blocked least-squares collocation, a new geoid of Nepal was computed by Fourier methods. The new geoid shows large changes to EGM08, illustrating the impact of the new data. The new geoid is compared to limited GPS-levelling data as well as recent GPS-heights of Mt. Everest, and the new data also provide an independent validation of GOCE gravity field models at the local ∼100 km resolution scale.},

The focus is upon the resolution of a recognized flaw in the currently prevalent model of this process, that denoted ICE-5G(VM2). The flaw concerns a previously noted inability of the model to simultaneously reconcile the VLBI and GPS measured rates of vertical and horizontal motion in the region of the North American continent that lay outboard and to the south of the Laurentide Ice-Sheet (LIS) at Last Glacial Maximum. This characteristic misfit of the model to the data has been suggested to be reconcilable only by recourse to models that explicitly incorporate the influence of lateral viscosity heterogeneity. It is demonstrated herein that, on the contrary, this flaw is entirely and unambiguously attributable to the theological stratification of the lithosphere, an influence not previously accounted for in global models of the GIA process but which must exist on a priori grounds.

A procedure was presented for investigation of structural capacity of the containment of the newly developed Generation III+ nuclear power plants (NPPs) in accidental scenarios. A containment vessel-soil model was developed and verified to investigate the transient response of the containment and subsequently induced vibrations on the ground surface. Ground vibrations can be used as input data to obtain the vibration of equipment inside the containment or inside buildings adjacent to the containment. Impact action was represented using a force-time history function imposed on the crash area of the containment surface. Then, a thermal analysis was conducted to predict the temperature fields following a mechanical-thermal stress analysis for fire resistance assessment. Results found the containment vessel-soil model was capable of predicting the transient and vibration responses of the structure. For the effect of impact positions on ground vibration outside the containment, impact positions in the mid-height and bottom portions of the containment induced slightly intensive ground vibration compared to impact in the upper portion of the containment. Thus, appropriate impact position should be considered when ground vibration response is a concern. Structural safety associated with fire effect was generally ensured mainly due to the low thermal inertia of concrete.},

Unlike other texts, this one takes the theory to a hands-on level by actually solving problems. It explains the concepts involved in the detailed analysis of composites, the mechanics needed to translate those concepts into a mathematical representation of the physical reality, and the solution of the resulting boundary value problems using the commercial finite element analysis software Abaqus. The first seven chapters provide material ideal for a one-semester course. Along with offering an introduction to finite element analysis for readers without prior knowledge of the finite element method (FEM), these chapters cover the elasticity and strength of laminates, buckling analysis, free edge stresses, computational micromechanics, and viscoelastic models and composites. Emphasizing hereditary phenomena, the book goes on to discuss continuum and discrete damage mechanics as well as delaminations. More than 50 fully developed examples are interspersed with the theory, more than 75 exercises are included at the end of each chapter, and more than 50 separate pieces of Abaqus pseudocode illustrate the solution of example problems. The author's website offers the relevant Abaqus and MATLAB{\textregistered} model files available for download, enabling readers to easily reproduce the examples and complete the exercises.

abstract = {Postseismic motion in the middle-field (100–500 km from the epicenter) geodetic data resulting from the 2012 Indian Ocean earthquake exhibited rapid change during the two months following the rupture. This pattern probably indicates multiple postseismic deformation mechanisms and might have been controlled by transient rheology. Therefore, the relative contribution of transient rheology in the oceanic asthenosphere and afterslip in the oceanic lithosphere should be incorporated to explain short- and long-term transitional features of postseismic signals. In this study, using two years of post-earthquake geodetic data from northern Sumatra, a three-dimensional spherical-earth finite-element model was constructed based on a heterogeneous structure and incorporating transient rheology. A rheology model combined with stress-driven afterslip was estimated. Our best-fit model suggests an oceanic lithosphere thickness of 75 km with oceanic asthenosphere viscosity values of 1 × 1017 Pa s and 2 × 1018 Pa s for the Kelvin and Maxwell viscosity models, respectively. The model results indicate that horizontal landward motion and vertical uplift in northern Sumatra require viscoelastic relaxation of the oceanic asthenosphere coupled with afterslip in the lithosphere. The present study demonstrates that transient rheology is essential for reproducing the rapidly changing motion of postseismic deformation in the middle-field area.},

abstract = {We present a new measure of earthquake clustering and explore its use for comparing the performance of three different declustering methods. The advantage of this new clustering measure over existing techniques is that it can be used for non-Poissonian background seismicity and, in particular, to compare the results of declustering algorithms where different background models are used. We use our approach to study inter-event times between successive earthquakes using earthquake catalog data from Japan and southern California. A measure of the extent of clustering is introduced by comparing the inter-event time distributions of the background seismicity to that of the whole observed seismicity. Theoretical aspects of the clustering measure are then discussed with respect to the Poissonian and Weibull models for the background inter-event time distribution. In the case of a Poissonian background, the obtained clustering measure shows a decrease followed by an increase, defining a V-shaped trend, which can be explained by the presence of short- and long-range correlation in the inter-event time series. Three previously proposed declustering methods (i.e., the methods of Gardner and Knopoff, Reasenberg, and Zhuang et al.) are used to obtain an approximation of the residual "background" inter-event time distribution in order to apply our clustering measure to real seismicity. The clustering measure is then estimated for different values of magnitude cutoffs and time periods, taking into account the completeness of each catalog. Plots of the clustering measure are presented as clustering attenuation curves (CACs), showing how the correlation decreases when inter-event times increase. The CACs demonstrate strong clustering at short inter-event time ranges and weak clustering at long time ranges. When the algorithm of Gardner and Knopoff is used, the CACs show strong correlation with a weak background at the short inter-event time ranges. The fit of the CACs using the Poissonian background model is successful at short and intermediate inter-event time ranges, but deviates at long ranges. The observed deviation shows that the residual catalog obtained after declustering remains non-Poissonian at long time ranges. The apparent background fraction can be estimated directly from the CAC fit. The CACs using the algorithms of Reasenberg and Zhuang et al. show a relatively similar behavior, with a time correlation decreasing more rapidly than the CACs of Gardner and Knopoff for shorter time ranges. This study offers a novel approach for the study of different types  of clustering produced as a result of various hypotheses used to account for different backgrounds. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {With a length of about 1200 km, the Son-Narmada-Tapti Lineament (NSL) is one of the most prominent geomorphic features in the Indian subcontinent. Anomalous conductive bodies are delineated at mid-lower crustal depths below major earthquake epicentral zones. The region has been interpreted as the collision zone of the Indian Plate with the Eurasian Plate. The NSL zone is therefore also known to be the second most important tectonic feature in the Indian geology, after the Himalayas. The present thesis describes significant new insight into the seismotectonics of this Central India tectonic zone, based on thorough magnetotelluric studies. The main objectives of the present study are: (i) to delineate subtrappean sediments across the NSL region along four different traverses, (ii) to understand the characterization of geo-electrical structure of the crust and examine the nature of geo-electrical signatures of the known faults, (iii) to integrate the results with other geophysical data such as seismicity, gravity and heat flow, in order to understand the tectonic scenario of the region. Deep electromagnetic (magnetotelluric) analyses were integrated in this study with gravity, seismic and heat flow studies and distinct, delineated deep crustal features. The resulting high conductivity is justified with the presence of fluids at mid-lower crustal depths. The migration of these fluids from mantle to mid-lower crustal depths through pre-existing brittle fracture/fault zones were obviously caused by the plume related to the Deccan volcanism. Migration of the fluids generated a higher fluid pressure along the faults and resulted in earthquakes. Based on the geo-electric sections derived along the four traverses of the Narmada-Son Lineament Zone, the present study gives important clues on the subduction/collision history in this important tectonic zone.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The receiver functions of body waves of distant earthquakes obtained for the regions beneath 41 digital stations (Lhasa and GANZ in Tibet, Mandalay and Rangoon in Myanmar, SHIO in India, CHTO in Thailand, and station network in Sichuan and Yunnan) were used to invert for S-wave structure in the crust and upper mantle in Sichuan, Yunnan, and their surrounding areas. Meanwhile the distribution characteristics of the Poisson's ration and the crustal thickness in Sichuan and Yunnan areas were also obtained. Results indicate that the depth of Moho beneath the eastern side of Qinghai-Tibetan plateau varies strikingly. It is obvious that the greatest changes in crustal thickness occur in a north-south direction. The crustal thickness decreases from north to south, being as thick as 70 km in eastern Tibet, the northern portion of our area of interest, and less than 30 km in Chaing Mai and Rangoon, the southern portion of our area. There are, however, exceptions regarding the trend. The thickness exhibits an east-west variation trend in the area from Ma-erkong-Kongding in Sichuan to Lijiang in Yunnan. In general the Jinpingshan-Longmenshan fault and Anninghe fault can be taken as the boundaries of this exception area. The thickness in Kongding in the west is 68 km, while it is only 39 km in Yongchuan in the east. Moreover the Poisson's ratio values in the blocks of central Sichuan and Sichuan-Yunnan Diamond are high, and a low velocity layer in the crust of this area can be obviously detected. The distribution characteristics of the high Poisson's ratio and the low velocity of the crust in this block correspond to the tectonic structure, being in contrast with the surrounding areas. Combining with the distribution features of the modern tectonic stress field, it is deduced that the Sichuan-Yunnan area is probably the channel through which the materials of the lithosphere flow eastward. {\textcopyright} Birkhaueser 2008.},

An 8 m high scarp running for more than 80 km in the Rann of Kachchh is the classical example of the surface deformation caused by the great earthquake (1819 Kachchh earthquake). Integration of geological/geomorphic and seismological data has led to the identification of 67 active faults of regional scale, 15 in the Himalaya, 17 in the adjoining foredeep with as many as 30 neotectonic faults in the stable Peninsular India. Large-scale trenching programmes coupled with radiometric dates have begun to constraint the recurrence period of earthquakes; of the order of 500–1000 years for great earthquakes in the Himalaya and 10,000 years for earthquakes of {\textgreater}M6 in the Peninsular India. The global positioning system (GPS) data in the stand alone manner have provided the fault parameters and length of rupture for the 2004 Andaman Sumatra earthquakes. Ground penetration radar (GPR) and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques have enabled detection of large numbers of new active faults and their geometries. Utilization of modern technologies form the central feature of the major programme launched by the Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India to prepare geographic information system (GIS) based active fault maps for the country.},

The aim of this research was to apply spatial analysis of thermal, aerial and acoustic environmental conditions inside a tunnel ventilated broiler housing, with a stocking density of 18 birds m(-2). This study was carried out in Rio Claro, SP, Brazil, in a 12 m x 115 m house divided into three equal sections (East, center and West), East-West oriented, and virtually divided on 132 cells, each one measuring 3.0 m x 3.5 m. At the geometric center of each cell the following variables were monitored: dry bulb temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, noise level and light intensity. Average broiler mortality was recorded in each of the three sections. Data collection was made systematically from West to East, opposite to the air flow produced by the tunnel ventilation system, during the warmest period of the day. Measurements took place during the sixth week of production. A geostatistics software tool was used to build spatial distribution maps of the recorded variables in order to infer intermediate stress conditions. It was concluded that the stress zones were located at both ends of the house and the highest mortality index was found at the West sector where the exhaust fans were placed.},

abstract = {The 24 January 2020 Mw 6.7 earthquake in eastern Turkey was due to the reactivation of the strike-slip faulting between the Arabian and Anatolian plates. To gain insight into the source regime and its relationship with historical earthquakes, we determined the coseismic slip distribution of this event by joint analyses of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar and teleseismic observations. Inversion results indicate that the main rupture asperity occurred in the southwest of the epicenter with a maximum slip of ∼ 1:9 m, showing a bilateral source process with an average rupture velocity of ∼ 1:6 km= s, and small slip extended to the surface near the epicenter. The estimated seismic moment is 1:4 × 1019 N{\textperiodcentered}m, associated with a ∼ 50 km long and ∼ 15 km wide fault plane. The aftershocks distribution is obviously complementary with the coseismic rupture zone. That is, the majority of aftershocks clustered in the transitional regions from the large to small slip areas. The 2020 earthquake only ruptured part of the locked zone and could increase the seismic activity in the East Anatolian fault zone during the interseismic phase. Two verified seismic gaps remain unbroken and hazardous.},

Each model is scored by comparison with sea-floor spreading rates, geodetic velocities, stress directions, and NUVEL-1A. Only models with active drag are successful.

abstract = {The role of the plate boundary in a continental collisional setting is investigated by lithospheric-scale analogue models. Key variables in this study are the degree of coupling at the plate interface and along the Moho of the lower plate as well as the geometry of the plate contact. They control the onset of intra plate deformation, orogenic architecture, amount of mantle lithosphere subduction and basin development. In all experiments, deformation initiates at the plate interface by the formation of a pop-up structure. A vertical plate boundary with respect to the shortening direction results in buckling of the lithosphere, whereas experiments with an inclined plate boundary show underthrusting and foreland basin development without orogenic wedge formation. Continental collision and coinciding mantle lithosphere subduction may occur only if the lower crust of the foreland plate is weak enough promoting crust-mantle decoupling. During decoupling the weak lower crust beneath the orogen thickens significantly by ductile flow as it detaches from the down going mantle lithosphere. This lower crustal thickening effects the distribution of upper crustal deformation and topography. Subduction of weak lower crust is favored when the weak plate interface has a significant thickness ({\~{}} 15 km in nature) and a high amount of shortening is applied. Increasing coupling at the plate interface through time leads to intra plate deformation by thickening and gentle folding and influences surface uplift and subsidence above the plate interface. The transition from a mechanically decoupled plate boundary with a significant amount of mantle lithosphere subduction towards stronger plate coupling resulting in intra plate deformation and topography development can be recorded in for instance the Caucasus, the Colombian Cordillera, the Pyrenees and the Alps. Thickening of the lower crust as portrayed for the Western Alps does not demand a strong, frictional-type behavior of the lower crust, but can also be the consequence of ductile processes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

By replacing a component in the generalized Kelvin model with the soft-matter component and connecting it in series with a nonlinear visco-plastic body, a nonlinear viscoelasto-plastic rheological model is proposed based on the fractional derivatives in order to describe the rheological behaviors of rocks. The data obtained from the triaxial creep tests of a typical rock are simulated with this model and the fitting result is good. The model can describe well three rheological stages of the rock during the triaxial creep tests. The validity of this model is then discussed. In this model, the fractional order $\beta$ controls creep strain rate in the stable creep stage under the condition of low stress; while the creep index n controls creep rate of the accelerated rheological stage under the condition of high stress. Few parameters and good simulation results manifest the outstanding performance of the model. The model also adopts the damage theory to describe the progressive deterioration of rock viscous coefficient of the accelerated creep stage. The model can also give an excellent description of the three rheological stages of rocks, especially the accelerated creep stage. {\textcopyright} World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract = {It is well known that deformation and/or strain of geological materials localize when they come close to the failure state. In the present study, we try to analyze the deformation problem using a constitutive relation with strain hardening and strain softening. The constitutive model of a soft rock and overconsoli- dated clay using an elasto-plastic constitutive theory with memory was originally developed by Adachi and Oka. This type of formulation is shown to be easily applied to analyze the material behavior of strain softening because there is a similarity to that in viscoplasticity. Using the proposed model, the loss of uni- queness of the solution to the initial value problem can be avoided and a special or complicated numerical technique, e.g., an arc length method, does not need to be used. When we use constitutive equations with strain softening in a finite element analysis, there is a problem of strong mesh size dependency of numerical results. To remedy the mesh size dependency, we generalize the Adachi-Oka model based on the concept of non-localization by Bazant. We apply the proposed constitutive model to the behavior of a sedimentary soft rock in the drained triaxial compression test. It is found that mesh size dependency becomes smaller using the non-localization of the constitutive model.},

Specifically, existing models are neither easy to invert nor integrate to obtain equivalent rectangular stress- block parameters for hand analysis and design purposes. The stress–strain relations proposed are validated for a whole range of concrete strengths and confining stresses. Then, closed form expressions are derived for the equivalent rectangular stress-block parameters. The efficacy of the results is demonstrated for hand analysis applied for deriving the moment-curvature performance of a confined concrete column. Results are compared with those obtained from a computational fiber-element using the proposed stress-strain model and another widely used model; good agreement between the two is observed. The model is then utilized in the development of a new structural system that utilizes the positive attributes of timber and concrete to form a parallel. Timber has the advantage of being a light weight construction material, easy to handle, is environmentally friendly. However, large creep deflections and significant issues with sound transmission (the footfall problem) generally limit timber use to small spans and low rise buildings. Concrete topping on timber sub-floors mitigate some of these issues, but even with well engineered wood systems, the spans are relatively short. In this study, a new structural system called structural boxed-concrete, which utilizes the positive attributes of both timber and reinforced concrete to form a parallel system (different from timber-concrete composite system) is explored. A stress-block approach is developed to calculate strength and deformation. An analytical stress-block based moment-curvature analysis is performed on the timber-boxed concrete structural elements. Results show that the structural timber-boxed concrete members may have better strength and ductility capacities when compared to an equivalent ordinary reinforced concrete member},

abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is regarded as a promising strategy for mitigating global warming. A 19{\%} CCS contribution to CO2 reduction by 2050, as envisaged by the International Energy Agency, would require the construction of thousands of CCS sites by the 2030s and beyond. CO2 storage may need to last for tens of thousands of years to avoid potential global warming and major Earth system changes, and a critical site selection criterion will be the likelihood of future escape of stored CO2 due to fault reactivation. However, future long-term intraplate stress field changes have not been considered in this context. Here we focus on Australia, where 61 potential CCS sites have been proposed, and model the evolving intraplate stress field due to the future growth of tectonic collisional forces north of Australia. Counter intuitively, the largest changes are predicted for some parts of western, central and southeast Australia, all regions far away from plate boundaries, reflecting the non-linear interaction of plate boundary forces with a geologically heterogeneous continent. We suggest that at least ten suggested CCS sites are located in regions where major changes of in situ stress regimes can be expected in the next 100,000 years, requiring a careful evaluation of potential future fault reactivation and a breach of reservoir seals. Our results highlight the importance of considering future intraplate stress field changes for selecting CCS sites, particularly within continental regions affected by ongoing mountain building processes including Australia, India, South America, Asia and southern Europe.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the present-day deformation mechanisms of the south central Chile margin, at the transition zone between two megathrust earthquake segments defined from historical data: the Valdivia and Concepci{\'{o}}n sectors. New GPS data and finite-element models with complex geometries constrained by geophysical data are presented to gain insight into forearc kinematics and to address the role of upper plate faults on contemporary deformation. GPS vectors are heterogeneously distributed in two domains that follow these two earthquake segments. We find that models which simulate only interseismic locking on the plate interface fail to reproduce surface deformation in the entire study area. In the Concepci{\'{o}}n domain, models that include a crustal-scale fault in the upper plate better reproduce the GPS observations. In the Valdivia domain, GPS data show regional-scale vertical axis rotations, which could reflect postseismic deformation processes at the edge of the M w 9.5 earthquake that ruptured in 1960 and/or activity of another crustal fault related to motion of a forearc sliver. Our study suggests that upper plate faults in addition to earthquake cycle transients may exert an important control on the surface velocity of subduction zone forearcs.},

Using a quasi-dynamic computational scheme and a finite difference solution of the conservation of energy equation we have determined the effects of spreading rate, adiabatic compression, radioactivity, phase changes, and strain heating on the temperature regime of a downgoing slab. Effects of these parameters on surface heat flux, gravity anomalies, and local seismic travel time are also estimated.

abstract = {The Makeng Fe (-Mo) deposit is the largest iron deposit in the Southwestern Fujian metallogenic belt of southeast China. This deposit's genesis has been disputed since the 1950s, with the primary view being that of the skarn type. Detailed geological investigations of the deposit were conducted to elucidate the ore-forming processes at work, as well as its localization. The investigations were based on computational geodynamic models that were, in turn, constructed by simulating the syn-extensional cooling of the ore-related intrusion. We have developed a FISH program to transform the MIDAS/GTS geometric solid model into the FLAC3D geodynamic discrete model. The occurrence of the granite xenoliths in ores and the sharp boundary of the ore body suggest that the ore body was formed at the tensile fracture spaces of the host rocks. The results of the numerical simulation show that most ore bodies are located in the weak zones of the limestone strata with dilation zones that are well-developed. Thus, the fluids from different sources can be easily focused due to the coupled mechano-thermo-hydrological (MTH) processes. The ore forming processes are closely related to the mechanical properties of sedimentary strata, especially regarding its competence and the contact relationship with different rock units. The computational model shows the same depth found through deep geological drilling, which also identified significant ore bodies. The simulation model will facilitate the selection of targets for further exploration of concealed deposits.},

abstract = {The selection and scaling of earthquake ground motions is an important step in defining the seismic loads that will be applied to a structure during structural analysis, and serves as the interface between seismology and engineering. Recent research suggests that potential problems caused by ground motion scaling are due primarily to discrepancies in the shape of elastic response spectra between the ground motion to be scaled and the ‘target' ground motion desired. These discrepancies may result in the scaled ground motions causing different levels of structural response than the response that would be caused by (unscaled) ground motions naturally at the intensity level of interest. A method for detecting such scaling bias is proposed, based on selecting a suite of ground motion records that have been scaled to all have the same intensity level (where here intensity is measured by spectral acceleration at the structure's first-mode period). The structural responses associated with the records are plotted versus the records' scale factors. Trends between the two values quantify the extent to which record scaling is causing biased structural response. Example results obtained using this method suggest that records selected based on the ground motion parameter $\epsilon$ (or that otherwise account for the spectral shape implied by ) can be safely scaled without introducing any bias, whereas $\epsilon$ the records selected using other methods have biased structural responses when scaled.},

We highlight the engineering importance of site-specific ground response analysis and difficulties faced in conducting a complete ground response analysis. Steps to be followed in conducting a meaningful site amplification study are explained. Difficulties/uncertainties in choosing an input ground motion are discussed and the various methods currently available for site amplification study are summarized. A case study on ground response analysis of a site in Ahmedabad City during the Bhuj earthquake is presented. The study shows that the varying degree of damage to multistorey buildings in the close proximity of Sabarmati river area in Ahmedabad was essentially due to amplification of the ground. Amplification was attributed to the fact that the natural frequencies of the building and frequency content of the ground motion recorded on the ground floor of the Regional Passport Staff Quarters building are in close proximity.},

abstract = {A MS 6.6 earthquake struck Jinghe County in Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on August 9, 2017. The earthquake occurred near the eastern part of the Kusongmuxieke Piedmont Fault (KPF) in the southwest of Junggar Basin. Using two pairs of coseismic SAR image data from the ascending and descending tracks from Sentinel-1 (European Space Agency), we processed the interferograms to obtain the coseismic deformation field. We calculate the fault slip distribution of the earthquake based on the elastic half-space rectangular dislocation model with the available location, geometry from seismic data and the coseismic deformation data. The results show that the earthquake deformation field has the typical characteristics of thrust faulting. The uplift deformation field is about 28 km long and 20 km wide. The maximum displacements of InSAR line-of-sight to the ascending and descending tracks are 49 and 68 mm, respectively. The main slip is concentrated at the depth of 10–20 km. The inverted seismic moment is equivalent to a moment magnitude MW 6.3. This result is very similar to the slip distribution from the seismological inversion. The maximum deformation area and the distribution of aftershocks are both on the west side of the mainshock. They mutually confirm the characteristics of a unilateral rupture. According to stress triggering theory, the aftershocks within 1 month after the mainshock in the layer 10–14 km deep may have been triggered by the mainshock, and the transferred stress increases the seismic risk of the eastern section of the KPF fault. After more than 1 year, a MS 5.4 earthquake occurred to the southwest of the MS 6.6 Jinghe earthquake. Beacause the stress drop change ({\textless}0.01 MPa) is too small for the MS 5.4 earthquake to have been directly triggered. Based on the analysis of multisource data and the detailed geological investigation, the thrust Jinghenan fault which north of Kusongmuxieke Piedmont fault is inferred to be the seismogenic fault of the MS 6.6 Jinghe earthquake.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The soil liquefaction is a major cause of damage in structures during earthquakes. This damage varies from small settlements to complete failure due to the loss of bearing capacity. To deal with these problems, piled foundations have been utilized in the presence of liquefiable soils in seismic zones. More recently, rigid inclusion foundations have been also considered. A fundamental approach to study the soil-foundation-structure interaction requires the determination of the influence of the kinematic and inertial effects in the system. In order to investigate the effects of this interaction, numerical models with a 3-storey reinforced concrete building founded on pile systems (soil-pile-structure)and rigid inclusion systems (soil-inclusion-platform-structure)were analyzed. Finite difference numerical models were developed using Flac 3D. The SANISAND constitutive model was utilized to represent the behavior of the liquefiable soil layer. This model predicts with accuracy the soil response for various soil densities, stress levels and loading conditions. The linear elastic perfectly plastic constitutive model with a Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion was used to represent the behavior of the non-liquefiable soil layers. Different relative density values of the sand layer were considered. Two earthquake signals were used to study the influence of the frequency of the systems excitation. For each case, the spectrum response, shear forces and rocking of foundations were obtained. Maximum shear strains and excess pore pressures were presented at different depths. The efforts and displacements in the rigid elements (piles or rigid inclusions)were also compared for the different systems. The results show that the relative density, the pile length and the frequency of the input motion greatly influence the response of the reinforced systems.},

abstract = {Subsurface structure in the Pakistan Himalaya is poorly known despite its geological importance in understanding the trend and growth of the Himalaya. In this paper, we compute receiver functions from a broadband seismic network in northern Pakistan and construct crustal structure beneath the stations. P to S converted phases at the Moho are clearly observed on stacked receiver functions. We model the conversions from the Moho and shallower interfaces using the trial and error method. Assuming a Vp/Vs ratio of 1.75, the modeled crustal thickness is 52-53 km in the Peshawar Basin, 55-62 km in the Lesser Himalaya, and 65-76 km in the Higher Himalaya. The variation of the Moho depth correlates well with surface topography, indicating an Airy type of isostasy in the Pakistan Himalaya. A large negative phase before the Moho conversion is consistently observed at all three stations to the north of the India-Asia suture, which is best modeled by a low velocity layer in the lower crust. The slow lower crust is likely caused by partial melt resulted from crust thickening. Volatile in the crust of the Kohistan island arc and the subduction and melting of the Indian upper crust may also contribute to the low velocity layer. Like the weak middle-lower crust in Tibet, this slow lower crust probably has an important role in the formation and growth of the western Himalaya.

abstract = {A three-dimensional (3D) finite-element program has been developed for the dynamic analysis of pile groups. Soil and pile media have been discretized into 3D isoparametric continuum elements. To simulate the stress transfer between soil and pile under lateral load, surface elements have been introduced at the interface. To avoid the radiation effect due to dynamic loading, it is proposed to use the appropriate boundary conditions with introduction of Kelvin elements at the transmitting boundary. The displacements at each time step are evaluated using the implicit Newmark-beta integration method. In the iterative procedure, stresses at a given Gauss point are first checked and adjusted against a limiting tension criterion, and then these stresses are further checked against a yield criterion. Extra stresses computed during these checks are converted to load vectors that are applied in the next iteration. A parametric study is carried out to consider the effect of pile spacing, number of piles, arrangement of pile, and soil modulus on the response of pile group.},

abstract = {The binned distribution densities of magnitudes in both the complete and the declustered catalogs of earthquakes in the Southern California region have two significantly different branches with crossover magnitude near M = 4.8. In the case of declustered earthquakes, the b-values on the two branches differ significantly from each other by a factor of about two. The absence of self-similarity across a broad range of magnitudes in the distribution of declustered earthquakes is an argument against the application of an assumption of scale-independence to models of main-shock earthquake occurrence, and in turn to the use of such models to justify the assertion that earthquakes are unpredictable. The presumption of scale-independence for complete local earthquake catalogs is attributable, not to a universal process of self-organization leading to future large earthquakes, but to the universality of the process that produces aftershocks, which dominate complete catalogs.},

On the whole, although the effect of the subducting PAC is dominant, coseismic deformation of the interplate earthquakes can be clearly seen in the inland. Moreover, the postseismic deformation of the earthquakes due to the viscoelastic upper mantle seriously affects the inland movements, and continues for a few decades. Our modeling, including the effects of the interplate earthquakes and the three-dimensional viscoelastic inhomogeneity, reasonably explains the observed movement. Finally, we stress that the viscoelastic effect should be taken into consideration in the analyses, even if no earthquakes occur in the analyzed period.},

abstract = {Slab detachment or breakoff is appreciated as an important geological process, as shown by recent tomographic imaging. Using a 2-D upper-mantle model 660-km deep and 2000-km wide, we have investigated with a 2-D finite-difference and marker-in-cell numerical technique the multi-resolutional character of the thermomechanical phenomena related to this complex geological process. Our experiments show that this process can be initiated in form of slab necking by a prolonged (8-30 My) period of slab weakening due to thermal diffusion ({\textless}20 °C/My) after cessation of active subduction. The rapid detachment process takes place over a few million years and is accelerated by non-Newtonian strain-rate softening and focused thermal erosion ({\textgreater}60 °C/My) due to strong positive thermal feedback from shear heating. Detached slab fragments sink rapidly with a tendency for coherent rotation. The influence of temperature- and pressure-dependent thermal conductivity on the process of thermal weakening of the slab is quite significant. This supports the idea that the breakoff process is triggered by thermal diffusion on a time scale linearly dependent on heat conductivity. Rapid topographic changes and increasing volcanic activities due to the melting of subducted oceanic crust are possible scenarios of this vigorously driven geodynamic process. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We have imaged the crustal configuration of the Mahanadi delta of eastern India by modeling both wide-angle seismic and Bouguer gravity data. This delta has undergone several stages of rifting, subsidence, sedimentation, and uplift. It is one of the important Gondwana sedimentary basins of India where widespread volcanic activity occurred during the Early Cretaceous along the rift zones. This volcanic activity corresponds to the breakup of greater India from east Gondwana (e.g., present Antarctica and Australia). We have derived a five-layer crustal model with velocities of 6.0, 6.5, 6.0, 7.0, and 7.5 km/s having estimated densities of 2.7, 2.8, 2.65, 2.9, and 3.05 g/cm3, respectively. The velocity-density relation along with heat flux and other geological/geochronological information indicates typical rift-related evolution of the delta with a midcrustal low-velocity (6.0 km/s) and low-density (2.65 g/cm3) zone and a ∼10 km thick high-velocity (7.5 km/s) and high-density (3.05 g/cm3) layer at the base of the crust, presumably due to underplating. The Moho upwarping or crustal thinning in the rift zone and emplacement of thick, high-velocity material at the base of the crust strongly suggests basaltic underplating probably due to the Kerguelen hot spot activity. These activities are synchronous with ∼117 Ma Rajmahal volcanism in northeast India and the Lambert graben in East Antarctica and are closely associated with the Gondwana breakup in the India-Antarctica sector. The rifting stages are closely correlated with the sedimentation phases of the lower and upper Gondwana deposits in the Mahanadi delta, which evolved parallel to the Lambert graben in East Antarctica.

Important terrain factors, contributing to landslide occurrences in the region, were identified and corresponding thematic data layers were generated. These data layers represent the geological, topographical, and hydrological conditions of the terrain. A numerical rating scheme for the factors was developed for spatial data analysis in a GIS. The resulting landslide susceptibility map delineates the area into different zones of four relative susceptibility classes: high, moderate, low, and very low. The susceptibility map was validated by correlating the landslide frequencies of different classes. This has shown a close agreement with the existing field instability condition. The effectiveness of the map was also confirmed by the high statistically significant value of a chi-square test.},

The low and intermediate Poisson's ratio values for stations located to south of the South Tibetan detachment are mainly due to the local geology and rock compositions. The low Poisson's ratio suggests felsic composition of the crust beneath the Sub and Lesser Himalaya. Extremely high value of Poisson's ratio in the Tethyan Himalaya at KHAB and HURL stations is related to the presence of fluid/partial melt in the crust rather than change in bulk composition of the crust. The low and intermediate Poisson's ratios at stations over the Sub, Lesser and Higher Himalaya suggest the absence of significant partial melting to south of the Tethyan Himalaya.},

abstract = {Conspectus The future application of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in electronic (nano)devices is closely coupled to the availability of pure, semiconducting SWNTs and preferably, their defined positioning on suited substrates. Commercial carbon nanotube raw mixtures contain metallic as well as semiconducting tubes of different diameter and chirality. Although many techniques such as density gradient ultracentrifugation, dielectrophoresis, and dispersion by surfactants or polar biopolymers have been developed, so-called conjugated polymer wrapping is one of the most promising and powerful purification and discrimination strategies. The procedure involves debundling and dispersion of SWNTs by wrapping semiflexible conjugated polymers, such as poly(9,9-dialkylfluorene)s (PFx) or regioregular poly(3-alkylthiophene)s (P3AT), around the SWNTs, and is accompanied by SWNT discrimination by diameter and chirality. Thereby, the $\pi$-conjugated backbone of the conjugated polymers interacts with the two-dimensional, graphene-like $\pi$-electron surface of the nanotubes and the solubilizing alkyl side chains of optimal length support debundling and dispersion in organic solvents. Careful structural design of the conjugated polymers allows for a selective and preferential dispersion of both small and large diameter SWNTs or SWNTs of specific chirality. As an example, with polyfluorenes as dispersing agents, it was shown that alkyl chain length of eight carbons are favored for the dispersion of SWNTs with diameters of 0.8-1.2 nm and longer alkyls with 12-15 carbons can efficiently interact with nanotubes of increased diameter up to 1.5 nm. Polar side chains at the PF backbone produce dispersions with increased SWNT concentration but, unfortunately, cause reduction in selectivity. The selectivity of the dispersion process can be monitored by a combination of absorption, photoluminescence, and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy, allowing identification of nanotubes with specific coordinates [(n,m) indices]. The polymer wrapping strategy enables the generation of SWNT dispersions containing exclusively semiconducting nanotubes. Toward the applications in electronic devices, until now most applied approach is a direct processing of such SWNT dispersions into the active layer of network-type thin film field effect transistors. However, to achieve promising transistor performance (high mobility and on-off ratio) careful removal of the wrapping polymer chains seems crucial, for example, by washing or ultracentrifugation. More defined positioning of the SWNTs can be accomplished in directed self-assembly procedures. One possible strategy uses diblock copolymers containing a conjugated polymer block as dispersing moiety and a second block for directed self-assembly, for example, a DNA block for specific interaction with complementary DNA strands. Another strategy utilizes reactive side chains for controlled anchoring onto patterned surfaces (e.g., by interaction of thiol-terminated alkyl side chains with gold surfaces). A further promising application of purified SWNT dispersions is the field of organic (all-carbon) or hybrid solar cell devices.},

abstract = {The intraplate stress field distribution is estimated by considering the isotropic elastic properties of the Indian plate using numerical analysis. In most modelling, the intraplate stresses are typically established on applying plate-driving forces to a homogeneous elastic plate. However, a tectonic plate comprises continental and oceanic lithosphere with sedimentary basins, cratons, and fold belts with varying significant differences in elastic properties, which likely affect the magnitude and pattern of stress and deformation. In the present study, the finite element method (FEM)-based software packages ABAQUS is used to simulate the intraplate stress distribution in the plate using a 3D mechanical model incorporating the elastic properties of the 19 geological regions of the Indian subcontinent and oceanic region. FEM models are validated with Indian plate fixed GPS velocities and found to be in reasonable agreement with the plate's velocity. This study can augment the interpretability of seismic and geological studies. Also, the model can be helpful to perform seismic hazard assessment (using the stress estimated with the FEM model), identify the seismically active zones and collect insight on active intraplate deformation of seismically active regions of the Indian plate by interpreting the strain rate, deformation rate and stress distribution data.},

abstract = {The timing of initial collision between India and Asia has remained controversial for half a century. This paper attempts to review this crucial and hotly debated argument, describing first the different methods used to constrain the age of collision and discussing next the rationale, results, inferences and problems associated with each. We conclude that stratigraphy represents the best direct way to unravel collision chronology. Other methods focusing on the magmatic, metamorphic or paleomagnetic record provide additional fundamental constraints, but cannot provide a robust direct estimate of collision onset. Initial collision in the central-eastern Himalaya is dated directly at the middle Paleocene (59 ± 1 Ma) by the abrupt change in sediment provenance recorded in trench settings. The quasi-synchronous unconformities documented along both Tethyan passive margin of India and active margin of Asia from Tibet to Zanskar-Ladakh confirm that orogeny was underway at the close of the Paleocene (56 Ma), well before the disappearance of marine seaways in the Himalaya during the early-middle Eocene (50–45 Ma). Sedimentary evolution and provenance changes in marine to fluvio-deltaic successions are recorded synchronously within error from the western to the central-eastern Himalaya, failing to provide conclusive evidence for diachronous collision. These coherent observations are hard to reconcile with three widely cited hypotheses invoking either Paleogene arc-continent collision or Late Cretaceous ophiolite obduction, or the protracted existence of a Greater India Basin, which are all not favored after discussing the geological evidence critically point by point. A scenario no more complex than the one involving solely the passive continental margin of India and the active continental margin of Asia is needed to explain the geological evolution of the nascent Himalaya. The collision between the Tethys Himalaya and the Transhimalayan arc-trench system does represent the collision between India and Asia. Because the Yarlung Zangbo Ophiolite is the forearc basement of the Asian active margin, its obduction onto India could not have preceded the initial closure of Neo-Tethys. Ophiolite obduction began when collision began, in the middle Paleocene.},

As the conventional Mohr-Coulomb (CMC) criterion has its limitation in the tensile shear region, a modified Mohr-Coulomb (MMC) criterion is proposed for clayey rock by considering the maximal tensile stress criterion. Based on the results of triaxial tests, a coupled elastoplastic damage (EPD) model, in which the elastic and plastic damage laws are introduced to describe the nonlinear hardening and softening behaviors, respectively, is developed so as to fully describe the mechanical behavior of clayey rock. Starting from the implicit Euler integration algorithm, the stress-strain constitutive relationships and their numerical formulations are deduced for finite element implementation in the commercial package ABAQUS where a user-defined material subroutine (UMAT) is provided for clayey rock. Finally, the proposed model is used to simulate the triaxial tests and the results validate the proposed model and numerical implementation.},

A new India-ITRF2008 angular velocity is estimated from 30 GPS sites, which include stations from western and eastern regions of the plate interior that were unrepresented or only sparsely sampled in previous studies. Our newly estimated India-ITRF2008 Euler pole is located significantly closer to the plate with {\~{}}3{\%} higher angular velocity than all previous estimates and thus predicts more rapid variations in rates and directions along the plate boundaries. The 30 India plate GPS site velocities are well fit by the new angular velocity, with north and east RMS misfits of only 0.8 and 0.9 mm/yr, respectively. India fixed velocities suggest an approximate of 1–2 mm/yr intra-plate deformation that might be concentrated along regional dislocations, faults in Peninsular India, Kachchh and Indo-Gangetic plain. Relative to our newly-defined India plate frame of reference, the newly estimated velocities for 43 other GPS sites along the plate margins give insights into active deformation along India's seismically active northern and eastern boundaries.},

abstract = {We investigate the distribution of focal depths for earthquakes that do not appear to be associated with zones of recent subduction, using both new results from analyses of individual events recorded at teleseismic distances and published data for both microearthquakes and larger events. The deepest events in oceanic regions occur in old lithosphere (= or {\textgreater}100Ma), and excluding earthquakes in active mountain belts, the deepest crustal events occur in old cratons (tectonic age = or {\textgreater}800Ma). Therefore, the temperature at the source region is likely to be an important factor determining whether deformation occurs seismically or not. From estimates of the temperatures at depths of the deepest events, we conclude that those limiting temperatures are approx 250-450oC and 600-800oC for crustal and mantle materials, respectively.-Authors},

abstract = {In order to understand the potential controls on Asian tectonics during the subduction of the Tethys and Indian lithospheres, we reconstruct the coupled subduction-continent deformation history using tomographic imaging, kinematics constraints and numerical modeling.The global P-waves tomographic images of the mantle below the India-Asia collision zone provide constraints on the deep structure of continents and subduction history. Linking the slab positions in the mantle to the Asian tectonics reconstructions and the Indian plate kinematics, we reconstruct the timing and location of successive subduction and breakoff events, showing one major breakoff occurred between India and the Tethys Ocean {\~{}}. 45. Ma. In the western syntax, a vertical slab continuous to the continent is shown to override the deeper detached Tethys slab. In the central region similar structure is found with a detached slab, yet closer to the Tethys slab. In the eastern syntax, no slab is imaged. It is inferred that after Tethys slab had broke off, subduction only resumed in the center of the margin, while underthrusting took place at both extremities of the convergent margin. During following convergence, a second breakoff event detached the central Indian slab from the margin {\~{}}. 15. Ma ago, which renewed Indian lithosphere underthrusting below Asia. This most probably occurred when the Tibetan Plateau was already uplifted, implying that uplift is not a direct result of underthrusting.Numerical models of breakoff during subduction illustrate the controls of slab detachment on the complexities of the Indian margin. In these models the subduction of continental lithosphere resumes after breakoff only where this is entrained by the mantle flow associated with the long lasting oceanic slab sinking, that is in the center of the margin, while converging continent edges underthrusts the upper plate. Furthermore, the breakoff during subduction has profound implications on the Asian intra-plate tectonics. In the models, the breakoff is rapidly followed by large stresses in the upper plate interiors, propagating at large distance from the margin, along a belt oriented at {\~{}}. 45° from the trench. The long-term evolution of the Asian continental tectonics shows drastic changes in the fault pattern, with successive strike-slip faulting across the Asian continent, which are in agreement with the mechanisms illustrated by the models. Transient large coupling at the trench caused by the breakoff events during India-Asia convergence offers an explanation for episodic nucleation of lithospheric faults within the Asian continent and their link to deep processes. {\textcopyright} 2014 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

abstract = {We model 56 segments of subduction zones using kinematically defined slabs based on updated geometries from Syracuse and Abers (2006) to obtain a comprehensive suite of thermal models for the global subduction system. These two-dimensional thermal models provide insight to the dehydration and melting processes that occur in subduction zones. Despite the wide range of slab geometries, ages, convergence velocities and upper plates the predicted thermal structures share many common features. All models feature partial coupling between the slab and the overriding plate directly downdip of the thrust zone, invoked to replicate the cold nose observed in measurements of heat flow and seismic attenuation. We test four separate assumptions about the causes of the partial coupling: (1) the downdip end of the partial coupling is at a constant depth, (2) it is at constant distance trenchward from the arc, (3) it is defined by a critical surface slab temperature, or (4) it is adjusted such that the hottest part of the mantle wedge beneath the arc is at a constant temperature for all subduction zones. In all of these models, slabs reach temperatures where the top of the oceanic crust and sediments dehydrate before they reach subarc depths, and the overlying mantle wedge is too hot for hydrous minerals to be stable at subarc depths. By contrast, the interior of the oceanic crust and underlying mantle within the downgoing plate remains cold enough for hydrous phases to be stable beyond the arc in all but the hottest subduction zones, allowing water to be carried beyond the arc in the slab. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The basic syntax of GMT scripts has evolved very slowly since the 1990s, despite the fact that GMT is generally perceived to have a steep learning curve with many pitfalls for beginners and experienced users alike. Reducing these pitfalls means changing the interface, which would break compatibility with thousands of existing scripts. With the latest GMT version 6, we solve this conundrum by introducing a new “modern mode” to complement the interface used in previous versions, which GMT 6 now calls “classic mode.” GMT 6 defaults to classic mode and thus is a recommended upgrade for all GMT 5 users. Nonetheless, new users should take advantage of modern mode to make shorter scripts, quickly access commonly used global data sets, and take full advantage of the new tools to draw subplots, place insets, and create animations.},

A comprehensive review of the literature and observations in regard to published test results would indicate that dilatancy is highly dependent both on the plasticity already experienced by the material and confining stress; moreover, it also appears that scale may play a non-negligible role. In our article, we provide a detailed analysis of published test data with a view to proposing a sufficiently significant but conveniently simple formulation of the dilatancy angle that reflects these dependencies and that can be readily implemented in numerical codes. The model is then tested, demonstrating that it is capable of representing rock sample strain behaviour in compressive tests. Finally, the model is applied to the resolution of ground reaction curves for tunnels in poor-to-average-quality rock masses, showing a good correlation with results obtained using practical rock engineering techniques. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The relative contribution of topographic (e.g., ridge push, continental margins, and elevated continental crust) and plate boundary (e.g., subduction and collisional) forces to the intraplate stress field in the Indo-Australian plate (IAP) is evaluated through a finite element analysis. Two important aspects of the IAP intraplate stress field are highlighted in the present study: (1) if substantial focusing of the ridge push torque occurs along the collisional boundaries (i.e., Himalaya, New Guinea, and New Zealand), many of the first-order features of the observed stress field can be explained without appealing to either subduction or basal drag forces; and (2) it is possible to fit the observed SHmax (maximum horizontal stress orientation) and stress regime information with a set of boundary conditions that results in low tectonic stress magnitudes (e.g., tens of megapascals, averaged over the thickness of the lithosphere) throughout the plate. This study therefore presents a plausible alternative to previous studies of the IAP intraplate stress field, which predicted very large tectonic stress magnitudes (hundreds of megapascals) in some parts of the plate. In addition, topographic forces due to continental margins and elevated continental material were found to play an important role in the predicted stress fields of continental India and Australia, and the inclusion of these forces in the modeling produced a significant improvement in the fit of the predicted intraplate stresses to the available observed stress information in these continental regions. A central focus of this study is the relative importance of the boundary conditions used to represent forces acting along the northern plate margin. We note that a wide range of boundary conditions can be configured to match the large portion of the observed intraplate stress field, and this nonuniqueness continues to make modeling the IAP stress field problematic. While our study is an important step forward in understanding the sources of the IAP intraplate stress field, a more complete understanding awaits a better understanding of the relative magnitude of the boundary forces acting along the northern plate margin.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Travel times and relative amplitude modeling of a seismic record section from the Koyna DSS profile in the Deccan Traps region has yielded a velocity model for the Indian continental subcrustal lithosphere. The observed record section, assembled with a reduction velocity of 6 km s-1 and using digitized data from analog deep seismic sounding (DSS) recorders, reveals a prominent wave group with an apparent velocity similar to but about 3 s after the reflected P phase from the Moho (PMP), at a reduced time of 7.5 to 6.5 s and recording distance range from 70 to 95 km. We interpret this strong amplitude phase as the reflection from an interface in the subcrustal lithosphere. Comparison of synthetic seismograms for a range of velocity models with the observed record section shows that the observed phase under investigation cannot be explained either by a reflected phase from a subcrustal velocity discontinuity with a single velocity increase or by the P-to-S converted phase (PMS) from the Moho. Subcrustal velocity models with a single low velocity layer (LVL) do not seem to give a satisfactory fit to the amplitude observations on the field record section. We prefer a subcrustal velocity model with alternating LVL (at least two with a velocity of 7.0-7.4 km s-1) separated by a thin high-velocity layer. In this model, the synthetic amplitudes of the reflected phase from the top of the deeper LVL at 56 km depth well match those of the observed reflection phase. It is inferred that the continental subcrustal lithosphere in this region of the Indian shield has a lamellar structure with significant vertical variation of structural and mechanical properties. The alternating LVL, occurring at relatively shallow depths below the Moho (velocity decreasing from 8.3 to 7.4 km s-1), may be associated with zones of weakness and lower viscosity. The LVL in the subcrustal lithosphere, as well as the LVL inferred in the upper and the lower crust (Krishna et al., 1989) together with the observed depth distribution of seismicity in this region, suggest a well-defined rheological stratification of the continental lithosphere with varying material properties. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a finite strain extension of a non-linear visco-plastic material model, previously proposed by the authors, and its application to the finite element simulation of incremental cold forming processes of thermoplastics, demonstrated on PVC. Preserving the original structure of the model, its finite strain extension does not rely on any presumed kinematic split, either multiplicative or additive, among elastic and inelastic parts. It uses a systematic replacement of the strain and stress tensors and their rates by their respective spatial counterparts. A deviatoric Oldroyd rate is introduced to preserve the objectivity as well as the deviatoricity of the integration of the rate forms of deviatoric tensors. To cope with the incremental loading paths within the process, where through-thickness variations of the variables gain importance, the material model is posed in 3D formulation. The developed model is implemented as an ABAQUS{\textregistered}/UMAT subroutine and used in the simulations following parameter identification studies. The numerical results are compared with analogous experimental ones to evaluate the performance of the material model where PVC sheets of three different thicknesses are formed incrementally with path controlled tool force monitoring. The investigations have the following consequences: the deformation-limited homogeneous stress-strain portion at uni-axial tensile tests, which is generally used in parameter identification of the constitutive model, is not able to reflect the post necking regime and its extrapolation ends up with a stiffer response with much less retained strains. Once a semi-inverse parameter identification is followed by taking into account the overall experimental outputs, one ends up with a considerable improvement in the tool force, geometry and the wall thickness predictions. Nevertheless, these improvements are inversely proportional with the sheet thickness where the local indentation effects (strains and stresses) become larger. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These predictions are based solely on the instantaneous physical characteristics of the acoustical signal and do not make use of its history. Surprisingly, machine learning identifies a signal emitted from the fault zone previously thought to be low-amplitude noise that enables failure forecasting throughout the laboratory quake cycle. We infer that this signal originates from continuous grain motions of the fault gouge as the fault blocks displace. We posit that applying this approach to continuous seismic data may lead to significant advances in identifying currently unknown signals, in providing new insights into fault physics, and in placing bounds on fault failure times.},

India, the second largest populous country of the world has experienced and is continuing to experience both inter and intra plate earthquakes, claiming life loss as well as damage to built environment. Apart from earthquakes, India has also experienced Tsunamis in both the directions; eastern tsunamis from Sumatra and western tsunamis from Makran. In this paper using past earthquake data, Indian plate interactions with its neighboring major (Eurasia, Africa {\&} Australia) and minor plates (Arabia, Burmese {\&} Sunda plate) have been understood. Upon clearly observing seven interactions, it is clear that interaction types, their lengths and thickness of plate play a great role in the occurrence of major to great earthquakes.},

abstract = {Landslides are short lived and suddenly occurring natural phenomena; it is just a hazard when it occurs in an uninhabited place, however it turns into a disaster causing extraordinary landscape changes and destruction of life and property when it occurs in the vicinity of human habitation. Landslides are particularly common and cause massive damage in tectonically active Himalayas. This work conducts a landslide hazard zonation in western Himalayan district of Kullu in Himachal Pradesh using remote sensing and GIS. The western Himalayan district of Kullu with a location on the southern side of Pirpanjal mountain range, an established history and inherent susceptibility to massive landslides has been chosen for landslide hazard zonation. The satellite imageries of LANDSAT ETM+, IRS P6, ASTER along with Survey of India (SOI) topographical sheets formed the basis for deriving baseline information on various parameters like slope, aspect, relative relief, drainage density, geology/lithology and land use/land cover. The weighted parametric approach was applied to determine degree of susceptibility to landslides. The landslide probability values thus obtained were classified into no risk, very low to moderate, high, and very high to severe landslide hazard risk zones. The results show that over 80 per cent area is liable to high- severe landslide risk and within this about 32 per cent has very high to severe risk.},

abstract = {Neotectonic stage stress and strain evolution was analyzed along a vertical lithospheric profile crossing the Dinarides, Pannonian Basin, Carpathians and East European Craton. A structural and lithological model was constructed based on distribution of seismic wave velocity along the Cel05 deep seismic sounding line. Rheological properties of each lithospheric layer were calculated as an average value for component rocks. In the applied model a highly laterally heterogeneous section of the lithosphere underwent 2.5{\%} of shortening during 7.5. Myr, which corresponds to neotectonic inversion of the Pannonian-Carpathian-Dinaric region. The coupled viscoelastoplastic model predicts stress regime changes, within mechanically partitioned lithosphere, that together with complex rheological properties controls the deformation pattern. Long-wavelength lithospheric buckling was initiated during the first stage of inversion. It was followed by development of short wavelength minor folding in the detached upper crust. The topographic surface within the basin and over the transition to adjacent tectonic units was modified by buckling and swelling mechanisms producing folds of 800. m amplitude. Buckling, more efficient in the initial stage of inversion, was over time substituted by crustal swelling that contribute to raising anticlines at the topographic surface due to isostatic compensation. Compound mechanism of folding causes migration of anticlines at the topographic surface and synclines at Moho, which finally produces gentle pinch-and-swell pattern in the crust. Efficient mechanism of continental lithosphere buckling was described under minor shortening and a low stress level. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {READ 1ST Abstract: Being fallen the entire North Eastern states of India in the Zone –V, the most seismic hazard zone (BIS-2002) and due to Geo-climatic condition, it is obvious that the region is highly prone to multiple natural disasters. Among these, the earthquake is the most destructive one causing huge loss of life and property. Earthquakes pose a real threat to India with 55{\%} of its geographical area vulnerable to seismic disturbance. Many earthquakes occurred in the past and recently had shown that major damages to the structures took place in the absence of proper design, construction and quality control. The bye law and BIS Specification were not strictly followed in many structures and suffer damages in the earthquakes. North East India is seismically one of the six most active regions of the World, the other five being Mexico, Taiwan, California, Japan and Turkey. In the recent past there were at least 17 major earthquakes with more than M 7 during the period from 1869 to 1988. Study of the Northeastern Indian's earthquakes history and findings of seismological researches, the region is now due for a large major earthquake, which is expected in the region between the epicentre of Shillong earthquake, M-8.7 of 1897 and Patkai Range {\&} Arunachal Pradesh , M-7 of 1950 in the near future. Earthquake hazards of North East India cannot be changed, however disaster can be mitigated. The most important steps for mitigation of hazard is the building up of capacity in Civil Engineering and Architectural Professionals for ensuring earthquake resistant constructions. Concerning the existing buildings and structures retrofitting is one of the most important options for mitigation of disaster as most of the destructions/ damages are caused due to the collapse of structure.},

P wave receiver function analysis reveals felsic continental crust beneath the Brahmaputra Valley, Shillong Plateau and Mikir Hills, and mafic thinned passive margin transitional crust (basement layer) beneath the Bengal Basin. Within the continental crust, the central Shillong Plateau and Mikir Hills have the thinnest crust (30 ± 2 km) with similar velocity structure, suggesting a unified origin and uplift history. North of the plateau and Mikir Hills the crustal thickness increases sharply by 8–10 km and is modeled by ∼30∘ north dipping Moho flexure. South of the plateau, across the ∼1 km topographic relief of the Dawki Fault, the crustal thickness increases abruptly by 12–13 km and is modeled by downfaulting of the plateau crust, overlain by 13–14 km thick sedimentary layer/rocks of the Bengal Basin. Farther south, beneath central Bengal Basin, the basement layer is thinner (20–22 km) and has higher Vs (∼4.1 km s−1) indicating a transitional crystalline crust, overlain by the thickest sedimentary layer/rocks (18–20 km). Our models suggest that the uplift of the Shillong Plateau occurred by thrust faulting on the reactivated Dawki Fault, a continent margin paleorift fault, and subsequent back thrusting on the south dipping Oldham Fault, in response to flexural loading of the Eastern Himalaya. Our estimated Dawki Fault offset combined with timing of surface uplift of the plateau reveals a reasonable match between long-term uplift and convergence rate across the Dawki Fault with present-day GPS velocities.},

abstract = {In the Zagros Mountains a formerly stable continental margin is being suddenly deformed. Finite element models of this tectonic flow are used to relate known surface deformations, earthquake locations, and fault plane solutions to unknown rock flow parameters and driving forces, in order to determine the latter. These two-dimensional plane-strain flow models incorporate the effects of nonlinear dislocation creep, frictional faulting, geological inhomogeneity, density anomalies, and varying temperature. All models driven by a subducting slab are unsuccessful because they require subduction of continental crust, which does not match present seismicity. Therefore the former oceanic slab must be detached, and the orogeny must be driven by horizontal compression in the lithosphere. Models also show that the subcrustal lithosphere is not shortened but acts as a stabilizing foundation. These results imply a simple geometry of crustal deformation which can be analytically modeled. The creep strength of the lower crust (75-100 bars) determines the topographic slope of the Zagros. The fact that subduction is not occurring on the old plate boundary places a limit on the shear stress deforming the cold upper crust. This limit is 300 bars if there is limestone at depth in the Crush Zone; otherwise 800 bars. These results are confirmed by a final finite element model. The total driving force of the orogeny associated with these limits is 2.8-5.5 {\textperiodcentered} 1015 dyne/cm, and the smaller amount could be provided by the gravitational spreading of the Red Sea rift. Shear-strain heating caused by the orogeny to date is less than 20°C. These results imply that even unheated continental crust is considerably weaker than laboratory friction measurements imply, and that it is mechanically decoupled at the Moho from the stronger mantle lithosphere. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

abstract = {In this overview, the Precambrian metallogeny in the Indian shield has been summarized in the backdrop of the evolution of different crustal domains and their linkages to the geodynamic history of the shield. The northern cratonic block (NCB) of the Indian shield is constituted by the Bundelkhand massif (BM), Aravalli-Delhi orogenic belt (ADOB), Shillong plateau and the Himalayan Proterozoic belts and is separated from the larger southern cratonic block (SCB) comprising the Singhbhum craton (SC), Bastar craton (BC), Dharwar craton (DC, including WDC, EDC as well as the Southern Granulite Terrain (SGT)) and the Eastern Ghat mobile belt (EGMB) by the ENE-WSW-trending Central Indian Tectonic Zone (CITZ). These two cratonic blocks are constituted by a few distinct crustal domains: the Archean cratonic nuclei and the Gneissic complexes with the granulitic or granite-greenstone terranes and the Proterozoic mobile belts and intra-cratonic basins, along with the anorogenic volcano-plutonic complexes and mafic dyke swarms. Within the various litho-tectonic domains of the Indian shield are concentrated vast resources of iron, manganese and aluminum and notable resources of chromium, copper, lead, zinc and uranium. There are also significant reserves of gold and tungsten as well as rare concentration of tin and platinoid metals. Titanium along with thorium and other REE are now largely concentrated in coastal placer deposits. Out of these, the Al and REE (including Th and Ti) resources, although derived from Precambrian rocks, are the products of metallogenic processes in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, and have been left out of the discussion.Metallogeny in the Indian shield spanned over a long period of 2.9. Gyr ({\~{}}. 3.6 to 0.7. Ga) during five specific epochs. The earliest mineralization (+. 3.5. Ga) is recorded from a BIF in SC. Paleo- to Mesoarchean ({\~{}}. 3.3 to 3.1. Ga) saw the formation of Ti-V-Fe, Cr. +. PGM, Au, Cu and Fe (BIF) in WDC and SC respectively. Intense and economically important metallogeny took place in Neoarchean (2.7 to 2.5. Ga) in SC, BC and DC represented by Fe, Mn, Cu-Mo, Sn, and Au and in Paleo- to Mesoproterozoic (2.2 to 1.5. Ga) in the mobile belts of SC, CITZ, ADOB and the Himalaya (Au, Cu-U, P-Fe, Mn, Zn-Pb-Cu, Pb-Zn deposits) and in intra-cratonic basins (Mn, Pb-Zn, U). In Neoproterozoic (1.0-0.75. Ga), the western fringe of ADOB saw VMS-type Zn-Pb-Cu and Zn-Cu mineralization as well as granite-related Sn-W deposits. Three of these metallogenic epochs coincide closely with Precambrian Supercontinent assembly of Kenorland ({\~{}}. 2.7. Ga), Columbia ({\~{}}. 1.8) and Rodinia ({\~{}}. 1.0.

abstract = {The Sunda arc has been modelled as a test subduction zone with geometrical complexities and varying dynamics. We simulated spatially the structural heterogeneities of the subduction zone and carried out our computations by a three-dimensional finite element approach. The aim is to estimate the lateral variation in the effective horizontal compressive stress in the interplate region, which can produce the present-day observed seismogenic stress field. In our simplified approach, the stress field has been modelled by varying the traction (ridge push), while keeping the age-dependent gravitational body force (slab pull) constant. Our result suggests that there is a considerable amount of stress dissipation in the decoupled segment of Java. At Sumatra, the required traction is much greater than that expected from the age-dependency relations. In our modelling, the transition from the dominance of the horizontal compressive stress to that of the gravitational pull in the regional stress field occurs around a depth range of 150-200 km. Lateral variation in the subducted slab volume emerges crucial to the seismogenic stress field and the derived pattern of displacement. Subduction of the lighter oceanic rise material should enhance the stress level. The effect of abrupt lateral variation in structure e.g., sudden changes in the slab dip or slab depth, may also be significant on the regional stress field. Viscoelastic modelling attempted for estimating the temporal variation in subduction dynamics suggests that the thrust level will increase southward of the present day thrust zone in Java, while strike-slip fault-type stress field will be developed south of Sumatra. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {The role of the seismic soil-pile-structure interaction (SSPSI) is usually considered beneficial to the structural system under seismic loading since it lengthens the lateral fundamental period and leads to higher damping of the system in comparison with the fixed-base assumption. Lessons learned from recent earthquakes show that fixed-base assumption could be misleading, and neglecting the influence of SSPSI could lead to unsafe design particularly for structures founded on soft soils. In this study, in order to better understand the SSPSI phenomena, a series of shaking table tests have been conducted for three different cases, namely: (i) fixed-base structure representing the situation excluding the soil-structure interaction; (ii) structure supported by shallow foundation on soft soil; and (iii) structure supported by floating (frictional) pile foundation in soft soil. A laminar soil container has been designed and constructed to simulate the free field soil response by minimising boundary effects during shaking table tests. In addition, a fully nonlinear three dimensional numerical model employing FLAC3D has been adopted to perform time-history analysis on the mentioned three cases. The numerical model adopts hysteretic damping algorithm representing the variation of the shear modulus and damping ratio of the soil with the cyclic shear strain capturing the energy absorbing characteristics of the soil. Results are presented in terms of the structural response parameters most significant for the damage such as foundation rocking, base shear, floor deformation, and inter-storey drifts. Comparison of the numerical predictions and the experimental data shows a good agreement confirming the reliability of the numerical model. Both experimental and numerical results indicate that soil-structure interaction amplifies the lateral deflections and inter-storey drifts of the structures supported by floating pile foundations in comparison to the fixed base structures. However, the floating pile foundations contribute to the reduction in the lateral displacements in comparison to the shallow foundation case, due to the reduced rocking components. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, the results of nonlinear dynamic analyses of a concrete containment building under extreme loads are presented. The impact of a large commercial B747 airliner is investigated as the extreme load, and a rigid wall impact test is performed using commercial nonlinear finite element codes. The impact forces exerted by the aircraft are verified compared with the time-dependent impact force provided by OECD/NEA (2002), which was calculated based on the so-called Riera method. The rigid wall impact analysis shows that the finite element model of a B747 is appropriate for the purpose of the aircraft crash analysis exposed to the external hazard of "Beyond Design-Basis Events" defined by U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Finally, the applicability of this methodology is further studied and verified by conducting parametric studies on the critical infrastructures of nuclear power plant containment structures. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Following disastrous earthquakes in Alaska and in Niigata, Japan in 1964, Professors H. B. Seed and I. M. Idriss developed and published a methodology termed the "simplified procedure" for evaluating liquefaction resistance of soils. This procedure has become a standard of practice throughout North America and much of the world. The methodology which is largely empirical, has evolved over years, primarily through summary papers by H. B. Seed and his colleagues. No general review or update of the procedure has occurred, however, since 1985, the time of the last major paper by Professor Seed and a report from a National Research Council workshop on liquefaction of soils. In 1996 a workshop sponsored by the National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research (NCEER) was convened by Professors T. L. Youd and I. M. Idriss with 20 experts to review developments over the previous 10 years. The purpose was to gain consensus on updates and augmentations to the simplified procedure. The following topics were reviewed and recommendations developed: (1) criteria based on standard penetration tests; (2) criteria based on cone penetration tests; (3) criteria based on shear-wave velocity measurements; (4) use of the Becker penetration test for gravelly soil; (4) magnitude scaling factors; (5) correction factors for overburden pressures and sloping ground; and (6) input values for earthquake magnitude and peak acceleration. Probabilistic and seismic energy analyses were reviewed but no recommendations were formulated. {\textcopyright} ASCE.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy bynhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The south Indian shield is a collage of Precambrian terrains gathered around and in part derived from the Archean-age Dharwar craton. We operated seven broadband seismographs on the shield along a N-S corridor from Nanded (NND) to Bangalore (BGL) and used data from these to determine the seismic characteristics of this part of the shield. Surface wave dispersion and receiver function data from these sites and the Geoscope station at Hyderabad (HYB) give the shear wave velocity structure of the crust along this 600 km long transect. Inversion of Rayleigh wave phase velocity measured along the profile shows that the crust has an average thickness of 35 km and consists of a 3.66 km s-1, 12 km thick layer overlying a 3.81 km s-1, 23 km thick lower crust. At all sites, the receiver functions are extremely simple, indicating that the crust beneath each site is also simple with no significant intracrustal discontinuities. Joint inversion of the receiver function and surface wave phase velocity data shows the seismic characteristics of this part of the Dharwar crust to be remarkably uniform throughout and that it varies within fairly narrow bounds: crustal thickness (35 ± 2 km), average shear wave speed (3.79 ± 0.09 km s-1), and Vp/Vs ratio (1.746 ± 0.014). There is no evidence for a high velocity basal layer in the receiver function crustal images of the central Dharwar craton, suggesting that there is no seismically distinct layer of mafic cumulates overlying the Moho and implying that the base of the Dharwar crust has remained fairly refractory since its cratonization.},

Loose sands, while shearing in drained triaxial test, show a hardening behavior and decrease in volume (compaction). In undrained triaxial test, (very) loose sands will undergo static liquefaction. The deviatoric mechanism (shear yield surface) of the Softening/Hardening model in RS 2 is adequate for simulating such behavior. Note that this model in its simplest form has one additional model parameter than that of the elasto-perfect-plastic Mohr Coulomb model.

Triaxial tests are the most common element tests performed on geomaterials in order to analyze their mechanical behavior. This tutorial will begin by explaining the procedure for using the experimental data to identify the material properties and evaluate the constitutive model parameters. Following this, the process of building the model in RS 2 , as well as incorporating the loading conditions of the triaxial test will be described. Kolymbas and Wu [1] performed a series of triaxial tests on a variety of samples of granular materials; this included drained triaxial tests on loose Karlsruhe sand. In " Fundamentals of Plasticity in Geomechanics " [2], Pietruszczak presents the experimental results of undrained triaxial tests on several different sands, including samples of very loose Banding sand. Both references provide a good collection of experimental data on the mechanical behavior of loose, medium and dense sand samples in triaxial tests. This tutorial will provide the reader with instructions to identify the material properties and constitutive model parameters from the experimental data and applying them in numerical modelling of their mechanical behavior in RS 2 .},

abstract = {Earthquakes constitute among the most feared natural hazards and these occur with no warning which can result in great destruction and loss of lives, particularly in developing countries. One way to mitigate the destructive impact of such earthquakes is to conduct a seismic hazard assessment and take remedial measures. This article aims at demonstrating significant contributions in the field of seismic zonation and microzonation studies in the Indian subcontinent. The contributions in the field of earthquake hazard have been very valuable and beneficial not only for science but also for society. The historical seismicity and seismic zonation studies as well as the present scenario of seismic hazard assessment in the Indian subcontinent, whether through probabilistic or deterministic approaches, are discussed. It has been found that many parts of the Himalayan region have peak acceleration values exceeding 0.6g. The epicentral areas of the great Assam earthquakes of 1897 and 1950 in northeast India represent the maximum hazard with acceleration values reaching 1.2-1.3g. The peak velocity and displacement in the same region is estimated as 120-177 cm s -1 and 60-90 cm, respectively. To mitigate seismic risk, it is necessary to define a correct response in terms of both peak ground acceleration and spectral amplification. These factors are highly dependent on local soil conditions and on the source characteristics of the expected earthquakes. This article will also present the findings of site-specific hazard assessment in megacities. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Quantification of seismic activity is one of the most challenging problems faced by earthquake engineers in probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. Currently, this problem has been attempted using empirical approaches which are based on the regional earthquake recurrence relations from the available earthquake catalogue. However, at a specified site of engineering interest, these empirical models are associated with large number of uncertainties due to lack of sufficient data. Due to these uncertainties, engineers need to develop mechanistic models to quantify seismic activity. A wide range of techniques for modeling continental plates provides useful insights on the mechanics of plates and their seismic activity. Among the different continental plates, the Indian plate experiences diffused seismicity. In India, although Himalaya is regarded as a plate boundary and active region, the seismicity database indicates that there are other regions in the Indian shield reporting sporadic seismic activity. It is expected that mechanistic models of Indian plate, based on finite element method, simulate stress fields that quantify the seismic potential of active regions in India. This article explores the development of a finite element model for Indian plate by observing the simulated stress field for various boundary conditions, geological and rheological conditions. The study observes that the magnitude and direction of stresses in the plate is sensitive to these conditions. The numerical analysis of the models shows that the simulated stress field represents the active seismic zones in India.},

abstract = {Cenozoic convergence between the Indian and Asian plates produced the archetypical continental collision zone comprising the Himalaya mountain belt and the Tibetan Plateau. How and where India-Asia convergence was accommodated after collision at or before 52Ma remains a long-standing controversy. Since 52Ma, the two plates have converged up to 3,60035km, yet the upper crustal shortening documented from the geological record of Asia and the Himalaya is up to approximately 2,350-km less. Here we show that the discrepancy between the convergence and the shortening can be explained by subduction of highly extended continental and oceanic Indian lithosphere within the Himalaya between approximately 50 and 25Ma. Paleomagnetic data show that this extended continental and oceanic "Greater India" promontory resulted from 2,675700km of North-South extension between 120 and 70Ma, accommodated between the Tibetan Himalaya and cratonic India. We suggest that the approximately 50Ma "India"-Asia collision was a collision of a Tibetan-Himalayan microcontinent with Asia, followed by subduction of the largely oceanic Greater India Basin along a subduction zone at the location of the Greater Himalaya. The "hard" India-Asia collision with thicker and contiguous Indian continental lithosphere occurred around 25-20Ma. This hard collision is coincident with far-field deformation in central Asia and rapid exhumation of Greater Himalaya crystalline rocks, and may be linked to intensification of the Asian monsoon system. This two-stage collision between India and Asia is also reflected in the deep mantle remnants of subduction imaged with seismic tomography.},

abstract = {A new evaluation of the elastic thickness (Te) structure of the Indian Shield, derived from isotropic fan wavelet methodology, documents spatial variations of lithospheric deformation in different tectonic provinces correlated with episodic tectono-thermal events. The Te variations corroborated by shear velocity, crustal thickness, and seismogenic thickness reveal the heterogeneous rheology of the Indian lithosphere. The thinned, attenuated lithosphere beneath Peninsular India is considered to be the reason for its mechanically weak strength ({\textless} 30 km), where a decoupled crust-mantle rheology under different surface/subsurface loading structures may explain the prominent low Te patterns. The arcuate Te structure of the Western Dharwar province and a NNE-trending band of low Te anomaly in the Southern Granulite Terrane are intriguing patterns. The average Te values (40-50. km) of the Central Indian Tectonic Zone, the Bastar Craton, and the northern Eastern Ghats Mobile Belt are suggestive of old, stable, Indian lithosphere, which was not affected by any major tectono-thermal events after cratonic stabilization. We propose that the anomalously high Te (60-85. km) and high S-wave velocity zone to the north of the Narmada-Son Lineament, mainly in NW Himalaya, and the northern Aravalli and Bundelkhand Cratons, suggest that Archean lithosphere characterized by a high velocity mantle keel supports the orogenic topographic loads in/near the Himalaya. The Te map clearly segments the volcanic provinces of the Indian Shield, where the signatures of the Reunion, Marion, and Kerguelen hotspots are indicated by significantly low Te patterns that correlate with plume- and rift-related thermal and mechanical rejuvenation, magmatic underplating, and crustal necking. The correlations between Te variations and the occurrence of seismicity over seismically active zones reveal different causal relationships, which led to the current seismogenic zonation of the Indian Shield. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Another shortcoming in the geodetic coverage occurs west of the primary rupture, where the existing geodetic observations suggest, but cannot resolve, sympathetic slip on secondary faults1. Such measurements, which are needed to place the Landers earthquake sequence in the context of a recurring seismic cycle in California, can be obtained with the dense spatial coverage provided by satellite radar interferometry5-9. Here we present radar maps of the surface deformation field which reveal features that would otherwise have been poorly sampled, particularly if the earthquake had occurred in a less accessible area. We see triggered slip at the level of several centimetres as far as 100 km from the primary rupture, and can resolve the geodetic signal of at least one small (magnitude ̃5) aftershock. The amount of surface slip following the main shock is less than a decimetre, and is consistent with an exponential decay time of several months for the postseismic deformation. {\textcopyright} 1994 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Deep seismic reflection studies investigating the exposed Archean lower continental crust of the Southern Granulite Terrane, India, yield important constraints on the nature and evolution of the deep crust, including the formation and exhumation of granulites. Seismic reflection images along the Kuppam-Bhavani profile reveal a band of reflections that dip southward from 10.5 to 15.0 s two-way-time (TWT), across a distance of 50 km. The bottom of these reflections beneath the Dharwar craton is interpreted as the Moho. Further south, another reflection band dipping northward is observed. These bands of reflectivity constitute a divergent reflection fabric that converges at the Moho boundary observed at the Mettur shear zone. Reflection fabrics that intersect at a steep angle are interpreted as a collisional signature due to the convergence of crustal blocks, which we infer resulted in crustal thickening and the formation of granulites. Anomalous gravity and magnetic signatures are also observed across the Mettur shear zone. The gravity model derived from the Bouguer gravity data corroborates seismic results. The tectonic regime and seismic reflection profiles are combined in a 3-D representation that illustrates our evidence for paleo-subduction at a collision zone. The structural dissimilarities and geophysical anomalies suggest that the Mettur shear zone is a suture between the Dharwar craton in the north and another crustal block in the south. This study contributes significantly to our understanding of the operation of Archean plate tectonics, here inferred to involve collision and subduction. Furthermore, it provides an important link between the Gondwanaland and global granulite evolution occurring throughout the late Archean. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},
